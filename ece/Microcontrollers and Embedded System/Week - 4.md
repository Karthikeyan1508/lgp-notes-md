# Microprocessor
A microprocessor is an electronic device used in computing devices like computers, smartphones, smart watches, and many other for data processing, performing logical and control operations. Microprocessors are generally built in the form an integrated circuit (IC).

A typical microprocessor consists of two main units namely, arithmetic logic unit and control circuitry. A microprocessor is also termed as CPU (Central Processing Unit) in personal computers. The microprocessor is a digital integrated circuit that works by taking binary data as input and processing this data as per the instructions provided. Finally, it produces a result in the binary form.
Microprocessors use both combinational and sequential circuits to perform arithmetic and logical operations in a digital system.

## What is a Microprocessor?

A microprocessor is nothing but a semiconductor electronic device designed to perform data processing and digital operations in a computing machine like a computer. It is also termed as a processor or central processing unit or CPU. It is generally built in the form of a single IC (integrated circuit). The first commercially available microprocessor was developed by Intel Corporation in the year of 1971, which was named as Intel 4004.

The primary function of a microprocessor is to take digital data from user, process them according to instructions, and produce the output. Hence, it performs three basic functions namely,

1. Inputting
2. Processing
3. Outputting
   
Here, it is also important to know that a microprocessor is different from a microcontroller which combines a complete computing system on a single chip.

## Block Diagram of Microprocessor
The block diagram of a typical microprocessor is shown in the following figure −

It consists of three main parts which are described as follows −

**1. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** − It is an electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and logical operations on data received from an input device or memory.

**2. Control Unit (CU)** − This electronic circuit of the microprocessor is responsible controlling the flow of data and instructions within the device or the system.

**3. Register Array** − Register array is nothing but a collection of digital registers to provide small and fast storage to temporarily hold data and instructions in the microprocessor during processes.
In addition to these three basic components, modern microprocessors also consist of cache memory as well.

## How does a Microprocessor Work?
The working of a microprocessor can be understood by breaking it down into the following four key steps −

**1. Fetch** − It is the very first function that a microprocessor performs. In this step, the microprocessor access data and instructions from memory unit or an input device.

**2. Decode** − After receiving data and instructions, the microprocessor decodes them and interprets for computing process.

**3. Execute** − In this step, the microprocessor performs the requested operations on the data.

**4. Store** − Finally, the results produced by the operations are stored in the memory unit.
Hence, a typical microprocessor completes its working in four steps, where each step represents a specific task or function.

These six elements are the main components of a microprocessor, let's discuss each of these components in detail and understand their functions.

## Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
ALU is the most important component of a microprocessor, as it is responsible performing all computing tasks and operations. As its name implies, ALU can perform the following two main operations namely,

**Arithmetic Operations** − It performs mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. of numbers.

## Characteristics of Microprocessor
A microprocessor is the most important component of a computing machine. It is basically a small electronic integrated circuit having capability of executing instructions and processing data to perform tasks or operations.

A microprocessor has several important characteristics that describe its working and performance. In this chapter, we will learn about all these key characteristics of microprocessors.

A microprocessor has various important characteristics, some key of them are explained below −

## Clock Speed

In a microprocessor, the clock speed, also known as clock rate, is defined as the frequency at which clock signals/pulses are generated by the microprocessor's clock generator. In other words, the clock speed can be defined as the number of execution cycles completed per second by the microprocessor.

Clock speed of a microprocessor is generally measured in Hz (Hertz). In case of modern microprocessors, it can be of the order of GHz. For example, when a microprocessor is said to have a clock speed of 4.5 GHz, then it means that it can execute 4.5 billion cycles in one second.

The clock speed of a microprocessor determines the processing speed of the processor. Thus, a microprocessor having a higher clock speed will complete tasks faster.

## Instruction Set

A group or set of commands written in machine language and the microprocessor can interpret is referred to as an instruction set of that microprocessor. An instruction set includes all possible instructions of the microprocessor that can improve its performance in the specific situations.

In a microprocessor, instruction sets direct the processor to switch the relevant transistors to perform the tasks. Microprocessor instructions are made up of a certain number of bits, where some of the bits represent the operation code while the remaining bits represent the operand.

For example, if a microprocessor has an 8-bit instruction set, then the first 4 bits represent the operation code that tells the system what to do, while the remaining 4 bits represent the operand that tells the system what data should be used. Instruction sets define the design, efficiency, and compatibility of microprocessors.

## Word Size

The word size of a microprocessor is defined as the number of bits processed simultaneously by the processor. For a microprocessor, the word size determines the amount of data that it can handle in a single operation. It also determines the overall performance of the computing system in which the microprocessor is used. Some very common word sizes of commercially available microprocessors include 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit.

Word size is a very important characteristic of microprocessors, because a larger word size represents that the microprocessor can handle more amount of data at one time and provides a better performance.

## Number of Processor Cores

A processor core is a single processing unit within a microprocessor that can execute instructions. If a microprocessor has more cores, then it can handle a greater number of tasks simultaneously. It is also important to note that each core of the microprocessor can independently execute instructions. Modern microprocessors come up with multiple cores such as dual-core, quad-core, octa-core, etc. Multiple cores provide multitasking functionality in the processor.

## Cache Memory

Cache memory is another important characteristic of a microprocessor which is directly linked its speed and performance. Cache memory is nothing but a high-speed, small-sized memory located within the microprocessor’s base structure. It is provided in the microprocessor to store most frequently used, recent instructions and data, enabling faster access to them. Hence, cache memory reduces the time required by the microprocessor for accessing data from the main memory and improves the overall performance of the system.

## Bus Width

It is also referred to as width of data bus. In the context of a microprocessor, bus width can be defined as the amount of data that can be transferred simultaneously during each operation. It is measured in bits, like 8-bit data bus, 16-bit data bus, 32-bit data bus, etc.

A wider bus width allows the microprocessor to handle a larger amount of data in a single operation and provides an enhanced speed and efficiency.

## Power Consumption

Power consumption or energy efficiency is another critical characteristic of a microprocessor. It becomes more important in the case of battery operated, portable devices like smartphones or laptops. It is desirable that a microprocessor must have a higher energy efficiency, so it consumes less power.

## Pipelining

In microprocessors, pipelining is a processing technique in which a sequential process is broken down into multiple sub-operations, and each sub-operation is then executed in its own dedicated segment in parallel with all other segments. Pipelining improves the performance of the microprocessor.

## Microprocessor - 8086 Functional Units

8086 Microprocessor is divided into two functional units, i.e., EU (Execution Unit) and BIU (Bus Interface Unit).

## EU (Execution Unit)

Execution unit gives instructions to BIU stating from where to fetch the data and then decode and execute those instructions. Its function is to control operations on data using the instruction decoder & ALU. EU has no direct connection with system buses as shown in the above figure, it performs operations over data through BIU.

Let us now discuss the functional parts of 8086 microprocessors.

## ALU

It handles all arithmetic and logical operations, like &plus;, −, ×, /, OR, AND, NOT operations.

## Flag Register

It is a 16-bit register that behaves like a flip-flop, i.e. it changes its status according to the result stored in the accumulator. It has 9 flags and they are divided into 2 groups − Conditional Flags and Control Flags.

## Conditional Flags

It represents the result of the last arithmetic or logical instruction executed. Following is the list of conditional flags −

- **Carry flag** − This flag indicates an overflow condition for arithmetic operations.

- **Auxiliary flag** − When an operation is performed at ALU, it results in a carry/barrow from lower nibble (i.e. D0 D3) to upper nibble (i.e. D4 D7), then this flag is set, i.e. carry given by D3 bit to D4 is AF flag. The processor uses this flag to perform binary to BCD conversion.

- **Parity flag** − This flag is used to indicate the parity of the result, i.e. when the lower order 8-bits of the result contains even number of 1s, then the Parity Flag is set. For odd number of 1s, the Parity Flag is reset.

- **Zero flag** − This flag is set to 1 when the result of arithmetic or logical operation is zero else it is set to 0.

- **Sign flag** − This flag holds the sign of the result, i.e. when the result of the operation is negative, then the sign flag is set to 1 else set to 0.

- **Overflow flag** − This flag represents the result when the system capacity is exceeded.

## Control Flags

Control flags controls the operations of the execution unit. Following is the list of control flags −

- **Trap flag** − It is used for single step control and allows the user to execute one instruction at a time for debugging. If it is set, then the program can be run in a single step mode.

- **Interrupt flag** − It is an interrupt enable/disable flag, i.e. used to allow/prohibit the interruption of a program. It is set to 1 for interrupt enabled condition and set to 0 for interrupt disabled condition.

- **Direction flag** − It is used in string operation. As the name suggests when it is set then string bytes are accessed from the higher memory address to the lower memory address and vice-a-versa.

## General purpose register

There are 8 general purpose registers, i.e., AH, AL, BH, BL, CH, CL, DH, and DL. These registers can be used individually to store 8-bit data and can be used in pairs to store 16bit data. The valid register pairs are AH and AL, BH and BL, CH and CL, and DH and DL. It is referred to the AX, BX, CX, and DX respectively.

- **AX register** − It is also known as accumulator register. It is used to store operands for arithmetic operations.

- **BX register** − It is used as a base register. It is used to store the starting base address of the memory area within the data segment.

- **CX register** − It is referred to as counter. It is used in loop instruction to store the loop counter.

- **DX register** − This register is used to hold I/O port address for I/O instruction.

## Stack pointer register

It is a 16-bit register, which holds the address from the start of the segment to the memory location, where a word was most recently stored on the stack.

## BIU (Bus Interface Unit)

BIU takes care of all data and addresses transfers on the buses for the EU like sending addresses, fetching instructions from the memory, reading data from the ports and the memory as well as writing data to the ports and the memory. EU has no direction connection with System Buses so this is possible with the BIU. EU and BIU are connected with the Internal Bus.

It has the following functional parts −

- **Instruction queue** − BIU contains the instruction queue. BIU gets upto 6 bytes of next instructions and stores them in the instruction queue. When EU executes instructions and is ready for its next instruction, then it simply reads the instruction from this instruction queue resulting in increased execution speed.

- Fetching the next instruction while the current instruction executes is called **pipelining.**

- **Segment register** − BIU has 4 segment buses, i.e. CS, DS, SS& ES. It holds the addresses of instructions and data in memory, which are used by the processor to access memory locations. It also contains 1 pointer register IP, which holds the address of the next instruction to executed by the EU.
  
   - **CS** − It stands for Code Segment. It is used for addressing a memory location in the code segment of the memory, where the executable program is stored.

   - **DS** − It stands for Data Segment. It consists of data used by the program andis accessed in the data segment by an offset address or the content of other register that holds the offset address.

  - **SS** − It stands for Stack Segment. It handles memory to store data and addresses during execution.

  - **ES** − It stands for Extra Segment. ES is additional data segment, which is used by the string to hold the extra destination data.
 
- **Instruction pointer**
 It is a 16-bit register used to hold the address of the next instruction to be executed.

# Microprocessor - 8086 Interrupts

Interrupt is the method of creating a temporary halt during program execution and allows peripheral devices to access the microprocessor. The microprocessor responds to that interrupt with an ISR (Interrupt Service Routine), which is a short program to instruct the microprocessor on how to handle the interrupt.

The following image shows the types of interrupts we have in a 8086 microprocessor −

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98f14f03-ad24-4040-a814-28c3d9bf4750)

## Hardware Interrupts
Hardware interrupt is caused by any peripheral device by sending a signal through a specified pin to the microprocessor.

The 8086 has two hardware interrupt pins, i.e. NMI and INTR. NMI is a non-maskable interrupt and INTR is a maskable interrupt having lower priority. One more interrupt pin associated is INTA called interrupt acknowledge.

## NMI

It is a single non-maskable interrupt pin (NMI) having higher priority than the maskable interrupt request pin (INTR)and it is of type 2 interrupt.

When this interrupt is activated, these actions take place −

- Completes the current instruction that is in progress.

- Pushes the Flag register values on to the stack.

- Pushes the CS (code segment) value and IP (instruction pointer) value of the return address on to the stack.

- IP is loaded from the contents of the word location 00008H.

- CS is loaded from the contents of the next word location 0000AH.

- Interrupt flag and trap flag are reset to 0.

## INTR

The INTR is a maskable interrupt because the microprocessor will be interrupted only if interrupts are enabled using set interrupt flag instruction. It should not be enabled using clear interrupt Flag instruction.

The INTR interrupt is activated by an I/O port. If the interrupt is enabled and NMI is disabled, then the microprocessor first completes the current execution and sends 0 on INTA pin twice. The first 0 means INTA informs the external device to get ready and during the second 0 the microprocessor receives the 8 bit, say X, from the programmable interrupt controller.

These actions are taken by the microprocessor −

- First completes the current instruction.

- Activates INTA output and receives the interrupt type, say X.

- Flag register value, CS value of the return address and IP value of the return address are pushed on to the stack.

- IP value is loaded from the contents of word location X × 4

- CS is loaded from the contents of the next word location.

- Interrupt flag and trap flag is reset to 0

## Microprocessor - 8086 Addressing Modes

The different ways in which a source operand is denoted in an instruction is known as addressing modes. There are 8 different addressing modes in 8086 programming −

**Immediate addressing mode**
The addressing mode in which the data operand is a part of the instruction itself is known as immediate addressing mode.

Example
```asm
MOV CX, 4929 H
ADD AX, 2387 H
MOV AL, FFH
```

## Register addressing mode
It means that the register is the source of an operand for an instruction.

Example
```asm
MOV CX, AX   ; copies the contents of the 16-bit AX register into  
             ; the 16-bit CX register),  
ADD BX, AX 
```

## Direct addressing mode
The addressing mode in which the effective address of the memory location is written directly in the instruction.

Example
```asm
MOV AX, [1592H]
MOV AL, [0300H]
```

## Register indirect addressing mode
This addressing mode allows data to be addressed at any memory location through an offset address held in any of the following registers: BP, BX, DI & SI.

Example
```asm
MOV AX, [BX]  ; Suppose the register BX contains 4895H, then the contents  
              ; 4895H are moved to AX 
ADD CX, {BX}
```

## Based addressing mode
In this addressing mode, the offset address of the operand is given by the sum of contents of the BX/BP registers and 8-bit/16-bit displacement.

Example
```asm
MOV DX, [BX+04]
ADD CL, [BX+08]
```
## Indexed addressing mode
In this addressing mode, the operands offset address is found by adding the contents of SI or DI register and 8-bit/16-bit displacements.

Example
```asm
MOV BX, [SI+16]
ADD AL, [DI+16] 
```

## Based-index addressing mode
In this addressing mode, the offset address of the operand is computed by summing the base register to the contents of an Index register.

Example
```asm
ADD CX, [AX+SI]
MOV AX, [AX+DI] 
```

## Based indexed with displacement mode
In this addressing mode, the operands offset is computed by adding the base register contents. An Index registers contents and 8 or 16-bit displacement.

Example
```asm
MOV AX, [BX+DI+08]
ADD CX, [BX+SI+16] 
```

## Maximum Mode and Minimum Mode in 8086 Microprocessor

The 8086 Microprocessor is one of the very popular microprocessors developed by Intel Corporation. Being a foundational component in microprocessor technology, it played an important role in computer architecture.

The 8086 microprocessor has a 16-bit architecture and a versatile design which allows it to operate in two different modes namely, Maximum Mode and Minimum Mode.

Each of these two operating modes are used in different system configurations and providing flexibility in addressing different system requirements. In this chapter, we will learn about basics, features, applications of and differences between maximum and minimum modes of the 8086-microprocessor.

## Introduction to Operating Modes of 8086 Microprocessor

In a microprocessor, an operating mode is nothing but a specific state or configuration of operation that determines how the processor will communicate or interact with other components of the system like memory, I/O, and other peripherals. The operating mode of a microprocessor defines its behavior and control during its operation.

In the 8086-microprocessor, there are two operating modes which are −

**Minimum Mode** − This operating mode of the 8086 microprocessor is designed for single-processor systems. In this mode, the microprocessor itself control the system bus.

**Maximum Mode** − This mode is designed for multi-processor systems, hence this operating mode allows multiple processors to operate simultaneously.

Let's have a detailed discussion on minimum and maximum modes of the 8086-microprocessor and their features.

## Minimum Mode of 8086

In the 8086-microprocessor, the minimum mode of operation is triggered by setting the pin MN/MX to logic 1. In this operating mode, the microprocessor produces all the control signals for memory and I/O operations. This mode of operation is primarily designed for one-processor systems. This mode is known for its simple configuration and low cost.

The following are some important features of minimum mode of the 8086 microprocessor −

- This mode supports only a single processor and unable to perform multiprocessing.
- The 8086-microprocessor itself generates all the control signals required for memory and I/O operations.
- In the minimum mode operation, the system has a straightforward architecture and requires a lesser number of components.
- In the minimum mode, the system has some basic components such as latches, transceivers, clock generator, memory, and I/O devices.
- Due to less number of components, the minimum mode makes the system cost-effective.

## Maximum Mode of 8086

When the MN/MX pin of the 8086-microprocessor is connected to logic 0, then the microprocessor operates in the maximum mode. In the maximum mode of operation, the 8086 microprocessor becomes capable to perform functions beyond calculations.

Maximum mode is mainly used, when the 8086-microprocessor is used in a multiprocessor system, as it allows multiple processors to work together. In this mode, an additional bus controller namely, 8288 bus controller, is used to control the system bus. Hence, the cost of maximum mode operation is higher and circuit is more complex.

Some of the key features of maximum mode operation of the 8086-microprocessor are highlighted below −

- This mode is mainly designed to use in systems having multiple processors.
- It provides multiprocessing capabilities.
- It improves the performance of the system by allowing simultaneous execution of multiple tasks.
- It uses an 8288 bus controller to control the system bus and manage the communication among multiple processors and devices.
- The maximum mode requires additional chips and components, and hence it makes the circuit more complex.
- Due to additional hardware components, the cost of maximum mode is high.

## Difference between Maximum Mode and Minimum Mode in 8086
The following table provides a comparative study of maximum mode and minimum mode of the 8086 microprocessor and highlights all the significant differences between them −

**Phases of Instruction Cycle:**

- Fetch: Retrieve the instruction from memory.

- Decode: Interpret the instruction.

- Execute: Perform the action specified.

- Store (if required): Save the result to memory or register.

Example:

An ADD instruction will be fetched from memory, decoded to identify operation and operands, then executed to add values.

## Flags

Flags are special flip-flops in the microprocessor that indicate the status of the processor or the result of arithmetic/logical operations.

**Common Flags:**

- Zero (Z): Set if the result is zero.

- Sign (S): Set if the result is negative.

- Carry (CY): Set if there is a carry out of the most significant bit.

- Parity (P): Set if the result has even parity.

- Auxiliary Carry (AC): Used in BCD operations.

**Use in Programming:**

Flags are checked using conditional jump or branching instructions.

## Stack and Subroutines

**Stack:**

A stack is a special area in memory used for temporary storage of data during program execution.

- Operates on Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

- Commonly used to store return addresses, temporary variables, and flags.

**Stack Pointer (SP):**

A register that holds the address of the top of the stack.

**Subroutines:**

A subroutine is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be reused.

- Control transfers using CALL instruction.

- Returns using RET instruction.

**Benefits:**

- Reduces code duplication.

- Makes code modular and easier to maintain.

## Bus Organization

The bus is a set of parallel wires or lines used to transfer data, addresses, and control signals between microprocessor and other components.

**Types of Buses:**

- Data Bus: Carries data between processor, memory, and I/O devices.

- Address Bus: Carries memory or I/O addresses to select locations.

- Control Bus: Carries control signals to manage operations.

**Characteristics:**

- Width of data bus determines how much data can be transferred at once (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit).

- Address bus width determines the maximum addressable memory.

- Control bus includes signals like Read/Write, Interrupts, Clock, Reset.

## Instruction Formats

Instruction format defines the layout of bits in an instruction. It includes opcode, operand, and addressing mode fields.

**Common Fields:**

- Opcode: Specifies the operation to be performed.

- Operand: Specifies the data or memory location.

- Addressing Mode: Indicates how to interpret the operand.

**Types:**

- Zero-address instructions: Use implicit operands (stack-based).

- One-address instructions: Use accumulator and one operand.

- Two-address instructions: Specify two operands.

- Three-address instructions: Specify three operands.

## Assembler and Assembler Directives

An assembler converts assembly language programs into machine code.

**Assembler Directives:**

- Instructions for the assembler, not executed by the CPU.

- Examples include defining memory areas, constants, and variables.

**Common Directives:**

- ORG: Set starting address for program.

- DB (Define Byte): Allocate and initialize byte data.

- DW (Define Word): Allocate and initialize word data.

- EQU: Define constants.

## Assembly Language Programming Examples for 8051 Microcontroller

**Example 1: Blinking an LED**
```
; Blinks an LED connected to P1.0
ORG 0000H
START:
    SETB P1.0       ; Turn ON LED
    ACALL DELAY
    CLR P1.0        ; Turn OFF LED
    ACALL DELAY
    SJMP START      ; Repeat forever

DELAY:
    MOV R1, #0FFH
    MOV R2, #0FFH
HERE:
    DJNZ R2, HERE
    DJNZ R1, HERE
    RET
END
```

**Example 2: Add Two Numbers**
```
; Adds 25H and 15H, result in ACC
ORG 0000H
    MOV A, #25H
    ADD A, #15H
    SJMP $
END
```

**Example 3: Data Transfer from Port**
```
; Reads data from Port 0 and sends it to Port 2
ORG 0000H
    MOV A, P0
    MOV P2, A
    SJMP $
END
```

**Example 4: Timer Delay using Timer 0**
```
; Toggle P1.0 using Timer 0 delay
ORG 0000H
START:
    CPL P1.0        ; Toggle LED
    ACALL DELAY
    SJMP START

DELAY:
    MOV TMOD, #01H  ; Timer 0, Mode 1
    MOV TH0, #0FCH
    MOV TL0, #66H
    SETB TR0        ; Start Timer 0
WAIT:
    JNB TF0, WAIT
    CLR TR0
    CLR TF0         ; Clear overflow flag
    RET
END
```

**Example 5: Check for Even or Odd Number**
```
; Check if number in A is even or odd
ORG 0000H
    MOV A, #05H
    ANL A, #01H
    JZ EVEN
    ; Odd case
    SJMP $
EVEN:
    ; Even case
    SJMP $
END
```
