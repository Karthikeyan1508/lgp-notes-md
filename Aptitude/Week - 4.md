# Logical Reasoning – Aptitude Notes

This document covers key Logical Reasoning topics essential for competitive exams and placement tests. It focuses on:

- Coding and Decoding  
- Directions  
- Linear and Circular Arrangements

Each topic is explained with its types, solving strategies, shortcuts, and example problems.

## 1. Coding and Decoding

### Definition:
Coding-Decoding tests your ability to decipher the rule or pattern used to transform a word, phrase, or number and apply it to new information.

---

### Types of Coding:

#### a. Letter Coding
Each letter in the word is replaced by another letter based on a particular pattern.

**Example:**  
If **CAT** is coded as **DBU**, then how is **DOG** coded?

**Solution:**  
C → D (+1), A → B (+1), T → U (+1)  
D → E, O → P, G → H  
**Answer:** **EPH**

---

#### b. Number Coding
Words or phrases are represented by numbers based on the sum of positional values, multiplication patterns, etc.

**Example:**  
If **SUN** is coded as **54**, find the logic.

**Solution:**  
S (19), U (21), N (14) → 19 + 21 + 14 = 54  
**Answer:** Addition of letter positions.

---

#### c. Substitution Coding
Words are replaced by other unrelated words.

**Example:**  
If “black” is called “white”, “white” is called “red”, and “red” is called “blue”, then what is the color of milk?

**Answer:** Milk is white → “white” is called “red” → **Answer: red**

---

#### d. Sentence Coding
Entire sentences are coded and the same logic must be used to decode similar statements.

**Example:**  
"Sun rises in east" → **ab cd ef gh**  
"Moon rises in night" → **ij cd ef kl**

What is the code for “rises”?

**Solution:** Common word = “rises” → common code = **cd**

---

### Strategies and Shortcuts:

- Learn letter positions (A=1 to Z=26)
- Reverse alphabet (Z=1 to A=26) for certain questions
- Use +, − shifts to test patterns
- Start with the most direct clue

---

## 2. Directions

### Definition:
Direction sense test evaluates your understanding of movement in cardinal directions (North, South, East, West).

---

### Types of Direction Problems:

#### a. Final Direction
Identifying the final direction after a sequence of turns.

#### b. Distance Calculation
Finding the shortest or total distance travelled.

#### c. Path Tracing
Locating final position or drawing the path.

---

### Example 1: Final Direction  
A man walks 5 km North, turns right and walks 3 km. What direction is he facing?

**Solution:**  
North → Right turn = East  
**Answer:** East

---

### Example 2: Distance Calculation  
A person walks 6 km North, 8 km East, 6 km South. How far is he from the starting point?

**Vertical movement:** 6 up − 6 down = 0  
**Horizontal movement:** 8 km →  
**Answer:** **8 km**

---

### Example 3: Displacement  
Starts at origin, moves 3 km North and 4 km East. What’s the shortest distance from start?

**Solution:**  
Pythagoras Theorem = √(3² + 4²) = √25 = **5 km**

---

### Shortcut and Visualization Tips:

- Use a direction map:
- Left/Right changes based on current direction
- For shortest path, use Pythagorean theorem
- Draw path wherever possible

---

## 3. Linear and Circular Arrangements

### A. Linear Arrangement

#### Definition:
People or objects are arranged in a straight line and questions are based on positions or relative distances.

---

#### Types of Problems:

- Finding who is sitting where
- Left/Right positions
- Number of persons between two
- Facing same or opposite direction

---

#### Example:
Five people – A, B, C, D, and E – are sitting in a row. B is to the right of A but left of C. Who is in the middle?

**Arrangement:** A – B – C  
**Answer:** **B**

---

#### Strategy:
- Use dashed lines or boxes to represent positions  
- Place fixed-positioned individuals first  
- Use elimination for conditions that depend on others

---

### B. Circular Arrangement

#### Definition:
People are seated around a circular table and you must determine positions based on left-right relationships and facing directions.

---

#### Facing Rules:

- If facing the center:
  - Left = counter-clockwise
  - Right = clockwise

- If facing outside:
  - Left = clockwise
  - Right = counter-clockwise

---

#### Example:
Six friends A to F sit around a circle facing the center. B is to the right of A. Who is to the right of B?

**Solution:**  
Draw a circle, mark A, place B to its right (clockwise), then find B’s right.  
**Answer:** Depends on full layout

---

### Common Terms in Arrangement Questions:

- **Immediate left/right**: Adjacent seat
- **Opposite**: Exactly across the circle
- **Between**: Count positions strictly between two people

---

### Strategy and Tips:

- Start with fixed information (e.g., X is to the immediate left of Y)
- Mark arrows for orientation (facing in/out)
- Create layout diagrams to visualize positions
- Practice mixed questions with unknown orientations

---

## Final Tips for All Topics:

- Read the entire question carefully before making assumptions
- Always write down intermediate steps, positions, and logic
- Diagrammatic representation is a powerful tool in both directions and arrangements
- Eliminate options using logic instead of guessing
