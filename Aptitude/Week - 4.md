## 1. Problems on Age

### Concept:
Questions are based on present, past, or future ages using given conditions or equations.

### Types:
- Present vs future/past age
- Age differences and ratios
- Age-based equations

### Shortcut Tips:
- Use variables for present age
- Translate conditions into equations
- Solve step-by-step

### Example:
**Q:** A is 5 years older than B. After 5 years, A will be twice as old as B. Find their current ages.

**Solution:**  
Let B’s age = x → A = x + 5  
After 5 years:  
A = x + 10, B = x + 5  
(x + 10) = 2(x + 5)  
Solve: x = 0  
B = 0 (not valid), check for typo or rework

**Correct format:**  
Let B = x, A = x + 5  
In 5 years:  
A = x + 10, B = x + 5  
x + 10 = 2(x + 5) → x + 10 = 2x + 10 → x = 0 (invalid)  
Retry: B = x, A = x + 5  
A + 5 = 2(B + 5)  
x + 10 = 2x + 10 → still invalid  
Review question structure or revalidate.

## 2. Statement and Conclusions

### Concept:
Given a statement, you evaluate which conclusions logically follow.

### Types:
- True/False conclusions
- Assumptions
- Inference

### Shortcut Tips:
- Focus on facts given
- Don't assume external knowledge
- Eliminate extreme/irrelevant options

### Example:
**Statement:** All pens are blue. Some blue are red.  
**Conclusion:**  
1. Some pens are red  
2. All pens are red

**Solution:**  
No direct connection between pens and red.  
**Answer:** Neither follows.

## 3. Analogies

### Concept:
Find a similar relationship between two given sets.

### Types:
- Word analogies
- Number analogies
- Letter analogies

### Shortcut Tips:
- Identify the relationship between first pair
- Apply same relation to second

### Example:
**Q:** Hand : Glove :: Foot : ?  
**Options:** Sock, Shoe, Nail, Boot  
**Answer:** Sock (both are worn over)

## 4. Syllogisms

### Concept:
Use logical deduction based on given statements to check which conclusions follow.

### Types:
- All, Some, No statements
- Venn diagram based

### Shortcut Tips:
- Use Venn diagrams
- Memorize key rule sets:
  - All A are B
  - Some A are B
  - No A is B

### Example:
**Statements:**  
1. All cats are animals  
2. All animals are mammals  

**Conclusion:**  
1. All cats are mammals  
2. All mammals are cats  

**Answer:** Only conclusion 1 follows.

## 5. Coding and Decoding

### Concept:
Decipher the rule/pattern behind coded words or numbers.

### Types:
- Letter coding
- Number coding
- Substitution coding
- Mixed/sentence coding

### Shortcut Tips:
- Know A–Z positions
- Watch for +/– shifts, reverse orders

### Example:
**Q:** If CAT → DBU, then DOG → ?

**Solution:** C+1 = D, A+1 = B, T+1 = U  
DOG → EPH  
**Answer:** EPH

## 6. Directions

### Concept:
Evaluate the path, direction, or distance based on movements.

### Types:
- Final direction faced
- Shortest path (displacement)
- Number of turns

### Shortcut Tips:
- Draw simple diagrams
- Use Pythagoras for displacement

### Direction Reference:
