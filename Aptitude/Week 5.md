### Overview:
Data Interpretation involves analyzing and answering questions based on graphical or tabular data.

### Types of Charts:

---

### 1. Tables

#### Format:
Rows and columns with numerical values for comparison.

**Example Question:**

#### Tip:
- Use approximate percentages when needed  
- Look for total, average, or difference-based questions

### 2. Pie Charts

#### Format:
A circle divided into sectors representing proportions.

**Strategy:**
- Total is usually 360° = 100%  
- Use sector angles or percentages to calculate values  

**Example:**
If Marketing = 90°, what percentage is it?  
→ 90/360 × 100 = 25%

### 3. Bar Graphs

#### Format:
Vertical or horizontal bars representing values.

**Strategy:**
- Compare heights or lengths  
- Focus on trends (increase, decrease, constant)

**Tip:**
- Be careful with scaled axes (e.g., jumps of 5 or 10)

### 4. Line Graphs

#### Format:
Data points connected with lines showing change over time.

**Strategy:**
