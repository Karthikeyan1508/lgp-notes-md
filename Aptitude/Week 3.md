## 1. Problems on Age

### Concept:
Age problems are arithmetic problems that involve finding the age of individuals at a given time—past, present, or future—based on given relationships.

### Common Problem Types:
- Present Age vs Past/Future Age
- Age difference/ratio relationships
- Age-based word problems involving family members
- Age problems involving time frames (e.g., “x years ago” or “after y years”)

### General Approach:
1. Let the present age be a variable (`x`, `y`, etc.)
2. Form expressions for ages at different times using addition or subtraction
3. Use ratios or differences to form equations
4. Solve the equations simultaneously

### Shortcut Tips:
- Translate sentences into equations step by step
- For questions involving ratios, multiply all terms to eliminate the fraction
- Use elimination or substitution in 2-variable problems

### Example 1:
**Question:** The sum of the ages of a father and son is 60 years. 5 years ago, the father’s age was 4 times the son's age. What are their current ages?

**Solution:**
Let son's current age = x  
Then father's current age = 60 - x  

5 years ago:  
Son's age = x - 5  
Father's age = 60 - x - 5 = 55 - x  

Given: 55 - x = 4(x - 5)  
55 - x = 4x - 20  
75 = 5x → x = 15

**Answer:** Son = 15 years, Father = 45 years

## 2. Statement and Conclusions

### Concept:
You are given a statement and a few conclusions drawn from it. You must decide which conclusions logically follow the given information.

### Types of Problems:
- Direct inference from facts
- Implied assumptions
- Valid or invalid conclusions

### Rules for Solving:
- **Only** use the information from the statement
- Watch out for **extreme language** in conclusions
- Conclusions must be **logically necessary**, not just possible

### Strategy:
1. Read the statement carefully
2. Evaluate each conclusion independently
3. Eliminate conclusions that use outside assumptions

### Keywords:
- “All”, “Some”, “No”, “Only”, “None” — determine strength
- “May be”, “Can be” — indicates possibility

### Example 1:
**Statement:** All roses are flowers. Some flowers fade quickly.  
**Conclusions:**  
1. Some roses fade quickly.  
2. All flowers are roses.

**Solution:**  
1. Cannot be concluded. The statement only says “roses are flowers” and “some flowers fade quickly,” but not that roses do.  
2. False. “All roses are flowers” ≠ “All flowers are roses”

**Answer:** Neither conclusion follows

## 3. Analogies

### Concept:
Analogies test the ability to identify relationships between pairs of words, numbers, letters, or patterns.

### Types of Analogies:
1. **Word Analogies** – Based on relationships like synonym/antonym, tool-function, cause-effect  
2. **Number Analogies** – Arithmetic or geometric patterns  
3. **Letter Analogies** – Alphabetical positions or skips  
4. **Visual Analogies** – Shape-based/logical patterns (in diagram-based questions)

### Strategy:
1. Determine the relationship between the first pair
2. Apply the same relationship to complete the second pair
3. Eliminate options with unrelated logic

### Word Analogy Examples:
**Example 1:**  
**Question:** Doctor : Hospital :: Teacher : ?  
**Answer:** School (workplace analogy)

**Example 2:**  
**Question:** Fire : Heat :: Water : ?  
**Answer:** Cold (effect analogy)

### Number Analogy Examples:
**Example 3:**  
**Question:** 3 : 27 :: 4 : ?  
**Solution:** 3³ = 27, so 4³ = 64  
**Answer:** 64

**Example 4:**  
**Question:** 2 : 4 :: 5 : ?  
**Solution:** 2 × 2 = 4, so 5 × 2 = 10  
**Answer:** 10

## 4. Syllogisms

### Concept:
Syllogisms are logical arguments consisting of two or more statements (premises) followed by conclusions. The goal is to assess if the conclusions logically follow.

### Basic Terms:
- **Universal Affirmative (A):** All A are B  
- **Universal Negative (E):** No A is B  
- **Particular Affirmative (I):** Some A are B  
- **Particular Negative (O):** Some A are not B

### Rules:
- All A are B → Some B are A (valid)  
- No A is B → All B are not A (valid)  
- Some A are B → Some B may or may not be A  
- Never assume reverse unless proven

### Diagrammatic Approach:
Use Venn diagrams to visualize relationships:
- Complete inclusion (circle inside another)
- Partial overlap
- No overlap

### Example:
**Statements:**  
1. All birds are animals.  
2. Some animals are mammals.

**Conclusions:**  
1. Some birds are mammals.  
2. Some animals are birds.

**Solution:**  
1. Not necessarily. Birds and mammals may not overlap.  
2. Some animals are birds (true — all birds are animals).  
**Answer:** Only conclusion 2 follows

## General Strategy for Logical Reasoning

1. Break down the question statement logically
2. Look for keywords and patterns
3. Translate statements to mathematical/logical format
4. Use elimination techniques for MCQs
5. Visualize if necessary (e.g., with Venn diagrams or number lines)
6. Don’t make assumptions beyond what is stated

## Practice Suggestions

- Spend at least 30 minutes daily on logical reasoning problems
- Start with one topic per day, and gradually mix them
- Use standard books and online practice sets
- Focus on both **speed** and **accuracy**
