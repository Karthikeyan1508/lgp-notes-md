## Maximum Power Transfer Theorem
Statement:
It states that the maximum power is dissipated when the load resisitance is equal to the source resistance.
Condition for Maximum Power Transfer:
To achieve power transfer in a circuit, the resistance or impedance of the load must match with the source impedance.
This means the load and source should have properties for efficient energy utilization and maximum power delivery.
