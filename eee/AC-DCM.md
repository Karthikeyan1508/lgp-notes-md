## DC Machines

An electromechanical device which can convert direct current (dc) electricity into mechanical energy or mechanical energy into direct current (dc) electricity is known as a DC machine.

If the DC machine converts DC electrical energy into mechanical energy, it is known as DC motor. If the machine converts mechanical energy into DC electrical energy, then it is known as a DC generator. Both DC motor and DC generator have the similar construction.

Working of DC Machine
The working principle and operation of a DC machine is based on an effect when a current carrying conductor coils laying in a magnetic field, the magnetic field produces a mechanical force on it known as torque which rotates the conductor coils in magnetic field. The direction of this produced torque can be found by the Fleming’s left hand rule (thumb is the force). The generated force can be calculated as follow.
F = BIL

Where:

F = Magnitude of the generated force
B = Flux density
I = Current
L = Length of the conductor

A typical DC machine consists of the following major parts:
- Yoke or Frame
- Armature
- Field System
- Commutator
- Brushes
- Bearings

The schematic diagram of a DC machine is shown below:

### Yoke or Frame
The yoke is the outer frame of the DC machine. It is made up of such materials that have high permeability and high mechanical strength. In practice, the yoke of DC machine is made up of cast steel.
The yoke or frame of the DC machine serves the following main purposes −

- It protects the internal machine parts like armature, windings, field poles, etc. against mechanical damages.
- The yoke houses the magnetic field system.
- It provides a low reluctance path to the working magnetic flux.
- It supports the rotor or armature through bearings.

### Armature
In DC machines (motor or generator), armature is a system of conductors or coils that can rotate freely on the supporting bearings. The working torque and EMF are developed in coils of the armature. The armature consists of two main parts namely, armature core and armature winding.

The armature core is a solid cylindrical structure, made up of high permeability thin silicon steel laminations. On the outer periphery of the core slots are cut to carry the armature winding.

The armature winding is made up of copper wires. The armature winding of DC machine is generally former wound. Depending upon the end connections of the armature conductors, the armature winding may be of two types namely lap winding and wave winding. The type of winding decides the voltage and current rating of the machine. In case of the lap winding, the number of parallel paths (A) for current to flow are equal to the number of poles (P) in the machine. On the other hand, for wave winding, the number of parallel paths (A) are equal to 2.

### Field System
Field system is the part of a DC machine which produces the working magnetic flux in the machine. It is basically a system of electromagnets which is excited by a DC supply. In case of DC machine, the field system is a stationary part of the machine and it is bolted to the yoke or frame of the machine. There are three main parts of a field system in dc machines namely pole core, pole shoes, and field coils.

The pole core is made up of thin steel laminations. One end of the pole core is bolted to the frame and other end has pole shoe. The pole core carries the field winding.

The pole shoe is a projected part of the pole core and has a large area of cross-section. Pole shoes help in spreading the magnetic flux uniformly in the air gap, and offers low reluctance path to the magnetic flux. Also, it supports the field winding.

The field coil or winding is made up of copper wire. The field winding is former wound and inserted around the pole core. When field windings are excited by DC supply, they become electromagnets and produce magnetic flux in the machine.

### Commutator
The commutator is one of the important parts of the DC machine. It is basically mechanical rectifier. It is a cylindrical shaped device and is made up of copper. The outer periphery of the commutator has V-shaped slots to carry commutator segments. Where, the commutator segments are copper bars inserted in the slots. These segments are insulated from each other by mica. The commutator is mounted on the shaft of the DC machine on one side of the armature. The armature conductors are connected to the commutator segments with the help of copper lugs.

The commutator performs the following two major functions:
- In a DC generator, it collects the current from the armature conductor. In a DC motor, it supplies the current to the armature conductors.
- It converts the alternating current of the armature into unidirectional current in the external circuit with the help of brushes, and vice-versa.

### Brushes
Brushes are used to make an electrical connection with the rotating commutator. These collect (or supply) current from (or to) the moving commutator. Brushes are usually made up of carbon. They are housed in brush holders and are in contact with the commutator surface with the help of spring pressure.

### Bearings
Bearings are used in the DC machine to reduce the frictional losses. Thus, the main function of bearings in the DC machine is to support the machine shaft with minimum friction. In DC machines, ball bearings or roller bearings are commonly used.

## Types of DC Machines

There are different types of DC machines like series, shunt, short shunt compound and long shunt compound.

According to the field excitation method, the DC machines are classified as;
- Separately Excited DC Machine
- Self-Excited DC Machine

### Separately Excited
In this type of machine, the field winding is electrically separate from the armature winding. There is no physical connection between the field winding and the armature winding.
In separately excited machines, the field winding is supplied from a separate power source.

### Self-excited DC Machine
In this type of DC machine, the field winding and armature winding are connected with each other. The performance characteristic of a machine depends on the connection between the field winding and armature winding.

According to the connection between field winding and armature winding, the DC machines are classified as;

- Series Wound DC Machine
- Shunt Wound DC Machine
- Compound Wound DC Machine

### Series DC Machine
In this type of DC machine, the field winding is connected in series with the armature winding. Because of the series connection, the entire load current (armature current) will pass from the field winding. And this current is high. So, the series field winding is designed with a smaller number of turns of thick wire to reduce the resistance.

### Shunt Wound DC Machine
In this type of DC machine, the field winding is connected in parallel with the armature winding. Because of the parallel connection, full voltage is applied to the field winding. Therefore, shunt winding is designed with a large number of turns with high resistance. The current flow through the field winding is very small. It is just 5% of the rated armature current.

### Compound Wound DC Machine
In this type of DC machine, two field windings are used. One winding is connected in series and second winding is connected in parallel with the armature winding.

The compound Wound DC Machine is also classified into two types;
- Short Shunt
- Long Shunt

### Short Shunt
If the field winding is connected in parallel with only the armature winding, the machine is called a Short shunt compound wound DC machine.

### Long Shunt
If the field winding is connected parallel with a combination of series field winding and armature winding, the machine is called a Long-shunt compound wound DC Machine.

## Applications of DC Machines
The use of electrical energy increases day by day. And because of that, the use of electrical machines is also increasing.

Generally, the DC machines are used in supplying excitation of an alternator and it is also used in many applications like welding process, variable-speed motor drives and electrolytic and electroplating process.

Small DC machines are used as a control device such as speed sensing, positioning, and tracking.
Application of DC Machine as a Motor
The DC motors are divided into three types; Series motor, Shunt motor, and Compound motor.

Series Motor
The series motors are used in the application where high starting torque is necessary and speed variation is possible.
Example- Vacuum cleaner, Air Compressor, Cranes, Traction system, etc.

Shunt Motor
The shunt motor is used in the application where starting torque is not needed more and running on the constant speed.
Example- conveyer, Lift, Fans, Lathe machine, Spinning machine, centrifugal pump, etc.

Compound Motor
The compound motors are used in applications where higher starting with constant speed is required.
Examples- Rolling mills, Elevators, Conveyer, Presses, etc.

### Application of DC Machine as Generator
The DC generators are classified as Separately excited DC generator, Shunt-wound, and Series-Wound generator.

Separately excited DC Generator
This type of DC generator is used for testing in laboratories. Because it has a wide range of voltage input. It is also used as a supply to DC motor.

Shunt-wound Generator
This type of generator used to charge a battery and provide excitation to the alternator. This type of generator also used for lighting purposes.

Series-wound Generator
Series-wound generators are used in locomotive for providing field excitation current as well as for regenerative braking. In a distribution power system, it is used as a booster.
