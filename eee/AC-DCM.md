## DC Machines

An electromechanical device which can convert direct current (dc) electricity into mechanical energy or mechanical energy into direct current (dc) electricity is known as a DC machine.

If the DC machine converts DC electrical energy into mechanical energy, it is known as DC motor. If the machine converts mechanical energy into DC electrical energy, then it is known as a DC generator. Both DC motor and DC generator have the similar construction.
