## DC Machines

An electromechanical device which can convert direct current (dc) electricity into mechanical energy or mechanical energy into direct current (dc) electricity is known as a DC machine.

If the DC machine converts DC electrical energy into mechanical energy, it is known as DC motor. If the machine converts mechanical energy into DC electrical energy, then it is known as a DC generator. Both DC motor and DC generator have the similar construction.

Working of DC Machine
The working principle and operation of a DC machine is based on an effect when a current carrying conductor coils laying in a magnetic field, the magnetic field produces a mechanical force on it known as torque which rotates the conductor coils in magnetic field. The direction of this produced torque can be found by the Fleming’s left hand rule (thumb is the force). The generated force can be calculated as follow.
F = BIL

Where:

F = Magnitude of the generated force
B = Flux density
I = Current
L = Length of the conductor

A typical DC machine consists of the following major parts:
- Yoke or Frame
- Armature
- Field System
- Commutator
- Brushes
- Bearings

The schematic diagram of a DC machine is shown below:

### Yoke or Frame
The yoke is the outer frame of the DC machine. It is made up of such materials that have high permeability and high mechanical strength. In practice, the yoke of DC machine is made up of cast steel.
The yoke or frame of the DC machine serves the following main purposes −

- It protects the internal machine parts like armature, windings, field poles, etc. against mechanical damages.
- The yoke houses the magnetic field system.
- It provides a low reluctance path to the working magnetic flux.
- It supports the rotor or armature through bearings.

### Armature
In DC machines (motor or generator), armature is a system of conductors or coils that can rotate freely on the supporting bearings. The working torque and EMF are developed in coils of the armature. The armature consists of two main parts namely, armature core and armature winding.

The armature core is a solid cylindrical structure, made up of high permeability thin silicon steel laminations. On the outer periphery of the core slots are cut to carry the armature winding.

The armature winding is made up of copper wires. The armature winding of DC machine is generally former wound. Depending upon the end connections of the armature conductors, the armature winding may be of two types namely lap winding and wave winding. The type of winding decides the voltage and current rating of the machine. In case of the lap winding, the number of parallel paths (A) for current to flow are equal to the number of poles (P) in the machine. On the other hand, for wave winding, the number of parallel paths (A) are equal to 2.

### Field System
Field system is the part of a DC machine which produces the working magnetic flux in the machine. It is basically a system of electromagnets which is excited by a DC supply. In case of DC machine, the field system is a stationary part of the machine and it is bolted to the yoke or frame of the machine. There are three main parts of a field system in dc machines namely pole core, pole shoes, and field coils.

The pole core is made up of thin steel laminations. One end of the pole core is bolted to the frame and other end has pole shoe. The pole core carries the field winding.

The pole shoe is a projected part of the pole core and has a large area of cross-section. Pole shoes help in spreading the magnetic flux uniformly in the air gap, and offers low reluctance path to the magnetic flux. Also, it supports the field winding.

The field coil or winding is made up of copper wire. The field winding is former wound and inserted around the pole core. When field windings are excited by DC supply, they become electromagnets and produce magnetic flux in the machine.

### Commutator
The commutator is one of the important parts of the DC machine. It is basically mechanical rectifier. It is a cylindrical shaped device and is made up of copper. The outer periphery of the commutator has V-shaped slots to carry commutator segments. Where, the commutator segments are copper bars inserted in the slots. These segments are insulated from each other by mica. The commutator is mounted on the shaft of the DC machine on one side of the armature. The armature conductors are connected to the commutator segments with the help of copper lugs.

The commutator performs the following two major functions:
- In a DC generator, it collects the current from the armature conductor. In a DC motor, it supplies the current to the armature conductors.
- It converts the alternating current of the armature into unidirectional current in the external circuit with the help of brushes, and vice-versa.

### Brushes
Brushes are used to make an electrical connection with the rotating commutator. These collect (or supply) current from (or to) the moving commutator. Brushes are usually made up of carbon. They are housed in brush holders and are in contact with the commutator surface with the help of spring pressure.

### Bearings
Bearings are used in the DC machine to reduce the frictional losses. Thus, the main function of bearings in the DC machine is to support the machine shaft with minimum friction. In DC machines, ball bearings or roller bearings are commonly used.

## Types of DC Machines

There are different types of DC machines like series, shunt, short shunt compound and long shunt compound.

According to the field excitation method, the DC machines are classified as;
- Separately Excited DC Machine
- Self-Excited DC Machine

### Separately Excited
In this type of machine, the field winding is electrically separate from the armature winding. There is no physical connection between the field winding and the armature winding.
In separately excited machines, the field winding is supplied from a separate power source.

### Self-excited DC Machine
In this type of DC machine, the field winding and armature winding are connected with each other. The performance characteristic of a machine depends on the connection between the field winding and armature winding.

According to the connection between field winding and armature winding, the DC machines are classified as;

- Series Wound DC Machine
- Shunt Wound DC Machine
- Compound Wound DC Machine

### Series DC Machine
In this type of DC machine, the field winding is connected in series with the armature winding. Because of the series connection, the entire load current (armature current) will pass from the field winding. And this current is high. So, the series field winding is designed with a smaller number of turns of thick wire to reduce the resistance.

### Shunt Wound DC Machine
In this type of DC machine, the field winding is connected in parallel with the armature winding. Because of the parallel connection, full voltage is applied to the field winding. Therefore, shunt winding is designed with a large number of turns with high resistance. The current flow through the field winding is very small. It is just 5% of the rated armature current.

### Compound Wound DC Machine
In this type of DC machine, two field windings are used. One winding is connected in series and second winding is connected in parallel with the armature winding.

The compound Wound DC Machine is also classified into two types;
- Short Shunt
- Long Shunt

### Short Shunt
If the field winding is connected in parallel with only the armature winding, the machine is called a Short shunt compound wound DC machine.

### Long Shunt
If the field winding is connected parallel with a combination of series field winding and armature winding, the machine is called a Long-shunt compound wound DC Machine.

## Applications of DC Machines
The use of electrical energy increases day by day. And because of that, the use of electrical machines is also increasing.

Generally, the DC machines are used in supplying excitation of an alternator and it is also used in many applications like welding process, variable-speed motor drives and electrolytic and electroplating process.

Small DC machines are used as a control device such as speed sensing, positioning, and tracking.
Application of DC Machine as a Motor
The DC motors are divided into three types; Series motor, Shunt motor, and Compound motor.

Series Motor
The series motors are used in the application where high starting torque is necessary and speed variation is possible.
Example- Vacuum cleaner, Air Compressor, Cranes, Traction system, etc.

Shunt Motor
The shunt motor is used in the application where starting torque is not needed more and running on the constant speed.
Example- conveyer, Lift, Fans, Lathe machine, Spinning machine, centrifugal pump, etc.

Compound Motor
The compound motors are used in applications where higher starting with constant speed is required.
Examples- Rolling mills, Elevators, Conveyer, Presses, etc.

### Application of DC Machine as Generator
The DC generators are classified as Separately excited DC generator, Shunt-wound, and Series-Wound generator.

Separately excited DC Generator
This type of DC generator is used for testing in laboratories. Because it has a wide range of voltage input. It is also used as a supply to DC motor.

Shunt-wound Generator
This type of generator used to charge a battery and provide excitation to the alternator. This type of generator also used for lighting purposes.

Series-wound Generator
Series-wound generators are used in locomotive for providing field excitation current as well as for regenerative braking. In a distribution power system, it is used as a booster.

## Types of DC Machines

A DC machine is a device which converts electrical energy in the form of direct current into mechanical energy or mechanical energy into electrical energy in the form of direct current. Therefore, a DC machine is basically an electromechanical energy conversion device. 
Based on the energy conversion, DC machines can be classified into the following two types: 
- DC Motor
- DC Generator 

### DC Motor
A DC machine which can convert mechanical energy input into electrical energy output is known as a DC generator. Thus, in a DC generator, the mechanical energy from a source like engine, turbine, etc. is supplied to the DC machine in the form of rotational energy of the shaft and the DC electrical energy is received as output from the armature terminals.

### working Principle of DC Generator
The working principle of DC generator is based on the Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction. According to this law, when the magnetic flux liked to a conductor or coil changes an EMF is induced in the conductor or coil. The magnitude of this induced EMF is given by,
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e635bca-bea6-4ccd-86a4-4173548ce013)
Where, ϕ is the flux linkage of the coil and N is the number of turns in the coil. 

In case of a DC generator, the magnetic flux (ϕ) remains stationary and the coil rotates. The EMF induced where the coil is rotating and flux is stationary, is known as dynamically induced EMF.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d27d1e8-7cd1-4046-b158-ff9a5c3c66fd)
In order to understand the working principle of a DC generator, we consider a single loop DC generator (i.e. N=1) as shown in above figure. Here, the coil is rotated by some prime mover (a source of mechanical energy), and there is a change in the magnetic flux linkage to the coil.  
Let ϕ be the average magnetic flux produced by each magnetic pole of the machine, then the average induced EMF in the generator is given by,
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3364ea2a-df42-41da-9614-b200423b65d4)

Where, P is the total number of poles in the generator and n is the speed of the coil in rotation per second. The expression in the Equation-(2) gives the average induced EMF in a single loop DC generator. 

The following points explain the working principle of a DC generator: 
- Position 1 – The induced EMF is zero because, the movement of coil sides is parallel to the magnetic flux. 
- Position 2 – The coil sides are moving at an angle to the magnetic flux, and hence a small EMF is generated in the loop. 
- Position 3 – The coil sides are moving at right angle to the magnetic flux, therefore the induced EMF is maximum. 
- Position 4 – The coil sides are cutting the magnetic flux at an angle, thus a reduced EMF is induced in the coil sides. 
- Position 5 – No flux linkage with the coil side and the coil sides are moving parallel to the magnetic flux. Therefore, no EMF is induced in the coil. 
- Position 6 – The coil sides move under a pole of opposite polarity and hence the polarity of induced EMF is reversed. The maximum EMF will induce in this direction at position 7 and zero when it is at position 1. This cycle repeats with rotation of the coil.
In this way, EMF is induced in a DC generator. Though, this induced EMF is alternating in nature, which is then converted in the unidirectional EMF by using a device called commutator.

### EMF equation of DC generator

The expression which gives the magnitude of EMF generated in a DC generator is called EMF equation of DC generator. We shall now drive the expression for the EMF induced in a DC generator. 
Let,

## Losses in DC Machines
In DC machines (generator or motor), the losses may be classified into three categories 
namely, 
- Copper losses
- Iron or core losses
- Mechanical losses 
All these losses appear as heat and hence raise the temperature of the machine. They 
also reduce the efficiency of the machine.

### Copper Losses 
In dc machines, the losses that occur due to resistance of the various windings of the 
machine are called copper losses. The copper losses are also known as I2R losses 
because these losses occur due to current flowing through the resistance of the windings. 
The major copper losses that occur in dc machines are as, 
Armature copper loss = 𝐼𝑎2 𝑅𝑎 
Series field copper loss = 𝐼𝑠𝑒 2 𝑅𝑠𝑒 
Shunt field copper loss = 𝐼𝑠ℎ
 2 𝑅𝑠ℎ 
In dc machines, there is also a brush contact loss due to brush contact resistance. In 
practical calculation, this loss is generally included in armature copper loss. 

### Iron Losses 
The iron losses occur in core of the armature of a DC machine due to rotation of the 
armature in the magnetic field. Because these losses occur in core of the armature, these 
are also called core losses. 
There are two types iron or core losses namely hysteresis loss and eddy current loss. 

### Hysteresis Loss 
The core loss that occurs in core of the armature of a dc machine due to magnetic field 
reversal in the armature core when it passes under the successive magnetic poles of 
different polarity is called hysteresis loss. The hysteresis loss in dc machines can be reduced by making the armature core of such materials that have a low value of Steinmetz’s hysteresis coefficient like silicon steel. 

### Eddy Current Loss 
When the armature of a DC machine rotates in the magnetic field of the poles, an EMF is 
induced in core of the armature which circulates eddy currents in it. The power loss due 
to these eddy currents is known as eddy current loss.

### Mechanical Losses 
The power losses due to friction and windage in a dc machine are known as mechanical 
losses. In a dc machine, the friction loss occurs in form of bearing friction, brush friction, 
etc. while the windage loss occurs due to air friction of rotating armature. 
The mechanical losses depend upon the speed of the machine. But these losses are practically constant for a given speed. 
Note: Iron or core losses and mechanical losses together are known as stray losses

### Constant and Variable Losses 
In DC machines, we may group the above discussed losses in the following two 
categories: 
- Constant Losses 
- Variable Losses 
Those losses in a DC machine that remain constant at all loads are called constant losses. These losses include: iron losses, shunt field copper loss, and mechanical losses. 
Those losses in a DC machine that vary with load are known as variable losses. The  variable losses in a DC machine are: armature copper loss and series field copper loss.
Total losses in a DC machine = Constant losses + Variable losses

power supplies.

## Induction Motor

Induction motors are the most widely used electric motors in industrial applications. Almost all induction motors run at essentially constant speed from no-load to full-load conditions. The speed of induction motors depends on the supply frequency and hence these motors are not easily adapted to speed control. Induction motors are simple and rugged in construction, less expensive, easy to maintain, and can be designed and produced with characteristics to suit most industrial requirements. An induction motor is an asynchronous AC electric motor which converts alternating current electricity into the mechanical energy. It is called an induction motor because the electric current in the rotor circuit required to produce the deriving torque is obtained through electromagnetic induction from the rotating magnetic field of the stator winding. These motors are referred to as asynchronous motors because their rotor rotates at a speed less than the synchronous speed of the rotating magnetic field.

The induction motor is an electromechanical energy conversion device, i.e. it converts electrical energy into mechanical energy in the form of rotation of shaft. Like any electric motor, an induction motor has two main parts namely stator and rotor.  
- The stator carries a set of windings called stator winding. The stator winding may 
be single-phase winding or three-phase winding.  
- The rotor carries a short-circuited winding called rotor winding.  
In case an induction motor, only the stator winding is fed from an AC supply, while the rotor winding derives its voltage and power from the stator winding through electromagnetic induction.

### Working Principle of Induction Motor 
The working of an induction motor is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction. In an induction, there are two windings namely, stator winding and rotor winding. The input AC supply is connected to the stator winding, the current flowing in the stator winding produces a magnetic flux. This magnetic flux is usually rotating, hence also called rotating magnetic field. The rotor winding of the induction motor is a short-circuit winding. The rotating magnetic flux from the stator cuts the short-circuited conductors of the rotor winding. According to Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction, an EMF is induced in the rotor circuit which causes a current to flow through it. When the current flows through the rotor winding, another magnetic flux being produced in the machine. Therefore, there are two magnetic fluxes inside the induction motor, one is stator flux and the other is rotor flux. These two magnetic fluxes interact with each other. Because of that, the rotor will experience a torque which makes the rotor to rotate in the direction of the rotating magnetic field of the stator. In this way, an induction motor runs.

### Types of Induction Motors
Depending on the type of input supply, induction motors are classified into the following 
two types: 
- Single-Phase Induction Motors: An induction motor that works on single-phase AC supply is called as a single-phase induction motor. 
- Three-Phase Induction Motors: An induction motor which requires three-phase AC supply to operate is called a three-phase induction motor.

### Advantages of Induction Motors 

The following are some major advantages of induction motors: 
- Induction motors have simple and rugged construction.
- Induction motors are relatively less expensive.
- Induction motors have relatively high efficiency.
- Induction motors can be designed to have characteristics to meet the industrial requirements.
- Induction motors need little maintenance. 

### Disadvantages of Induction Motors 

The main disadvantages of induction motors are as follows: 
- The speed of induction motors cannot be changed easily because they are essentially constant speed motors. 
- Induction motors draw a high inrush current at starting. 
- Induction motors always operate at lagging power factor. 
- Single-phase induction motors are not self-starting; hence we need provide some 
extra starting mechanism.

### Types of Single-Phase Induction Motors 

Depending upon the method employed to make the motor self-starting, single-phase 
induction motors may be classified into the following three types: 
- Split-phase induction motor
- Capacitor-start induction motor
- Capacitor-start capacitor-run induction motor

### Split-Phase Induction Motor 
A split-phase induction motor is a type of single-phase induction motor in which the stator consists of two windings namely, a starting winding and a main winding, where the starting winding is displaced by 90° electrical from the main winding. The starting winding operates only during the starting period of the motor. The starting and main windings are so designed that the starting winding has high resistance and relatively low reactance, while the main winding has relatively low resistance and high reactance so that currents flowing in the two windings have a reasonable phase difference (α) of about 25° to 30°.

### Capacitor-Start Induction Motor
The type of single-phase induction motor in which a capacitor C is connected in series with the starting winding as shown in Figure-2. This capacitor is called starting capacitor. The value of starting capacitor is so chosen that the starting current Is leads the current Im through the main winding by about 80°. Once the motor attains about 75% of the rated speed, a centrifugal switch isolates the starting winding from the circuit. The motor then operates as a single-phase induction motor and continues to accelerate till it reaches the normal speed. Therefore, in this type of single-phase induction motor, the capacitor in series with the starting winding introduces a phase shift between the two windings so that the motor can start itself. 

### Capacitor-Start Capacitor-Run Induction Motor 
This motor is almost identical to a capacitor-start induction motor except that the starting winding is not disconnected from the motor circuit. Therefore, in case of capacitor-start capacitor-run induction motor, both the windings (starting winding & main winding) remain connected to the supply during starting as well as running period.

### Applications of Single-Phase Induction Motors 

- Single-phase induction motors are mainly used in domestic and commercial appliances like fans, ACs, refrigerators, air-cooler, washing machines, etc. Given below are some of the applications of different kinds of single-phase induction motors:

- Split-Phase Induction Motors: These motors are best suited for moderate starting-torque applications like fans, washing machines, oil burners, small machine tools, etc. 

- Capacitor-Start Induction Motors: These motors are suitable for applications that require relatively high-starting torque like compressors, large fans, pumps and high-inertia loads, etc. 

- Capacitor-Start Capacitor-Run Induction Motors: These motors are suitable for constant torque, and vibration free applications like in hospital appliances, studio equipment and in many other appliances that are used in such areas where silence is important.

## Three-Phase Induction Motor

As the name suggests, a three-phase induction motor is one which works on three-phase AC supply, and converts three-phase AC electricity into mechanical energy. Three-phase induction motors are the most extensively used electric motors in industries. These motors run at almost a constant speed from no-load to full-load, i.e., they have good speed regulation. Although the speed of three-phase induction motors depends on the supply frequency and number of poles in the machine and therefore, it is quite difficult to change their speed. Just like any other electric motor, a typical three-phase induction motor also consists of two main parts namely stator and rotor. The stator is a stationary part and carries a three phase winding, called stator winding. The rotor is a rotating part of the motor and carries a short-circuited winding, called rotor winding. The stator winding of a three-phase induction motor is fed from a three-phase balanced AC supply, while the rotor winding derives its working voltage and power from the stator winding via electromagnetic induction. This is why, it is named so. A three-phase induction motor may be considered to be a three-phase transformer with a rotating secondary winding. Therefore, it could be described as a transformer-type AC machine. The only difference is that the induction motor converts electricity into mechanical energy.

### Types of Three-Phase Induction Motors 
According to the rotor construction, three-phase induction motors are classified into the 
following two basic types: 
- Squirrel-Cage Induction Motor 
- Slip-Ring Induction Motor
