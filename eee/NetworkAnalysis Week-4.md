# TWO PORT NETWORK ANALYSIS
A pair of terminals at which a signal may enter or leave a network is called a port. A port is defined as any pair of terminals into which energy is supplied or from which energy is withdrawn, or where the network variables may be measured, One such network having only one pair of terminals (1-1') i

A two-port network is simply a network inside a black box, and the network has only two pairs of accessible terminals; usually one pair represents the input and the other represents the output. Such a building block is very common in electronic systems, communication systems, transmission, and distribution systems. The Figure(b) shows a twoport network, or a two terminal pair network, in which the four terminals have been paired into ports 1-1' and 2-2'. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/752d84e2-047b-494c-b2cd-3260c575be89)

The terminals 1-1' together constitute a port. Similarly, the terminals 2-2' constitute another port. Two ports containing no sources in their branches are called passive ports; among them are power transmission lines and transformers. Two ports containing sources in their branches are called active ports. A voltage and current assigned to each of the two ports. 
The voltage and current at the input terminals are V1 and I1; whereas V2 and I2 are specified at the output port. It is also assumed that the currents I1 and I2 are entering into the network at the upper terminals 1 and 2, respectively. The variables of the two-port network are V1, V2, and I1, I2. Two of these are dependent variables; the other two are independent variables. The number of possible combinations generated by the four variables, taken two at a time is six. Thus, there are six possible sets of equations describing a two-port network.

## OPEN-CIRCUIT IMPEDANCE PARAMETERS (Z PARAMETERS)
A two-port network is redrawn as in Figure. Here, we consider V1 and V2 as dependent variables and I1 and I2 as independent variables. Let Z11, Z12, Z21 and Z22 are the Z-parameters. The voltage V1 and V2 in terms of I1 and I2 are expressed as follows:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9e374cd-4eb1-44b0-a676-5385982875a8)

In terms of matrix equations, the following can be obtained:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bbcd401-d019-493a-92a6-c1c4e6490425)

is called impedance matrix

The individual Z-parameters can be found as indicated in the following. When the output-port is open-circuited, that is, when I2 = 0, the equation will be as follows:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/491e4ea7-ae25-48d4-88cf-fdfc99c0b9d6)

When the input port is open-circuited, that is, when I1 = 0, then equation (11.1) will be given as follows:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59034ecb-ab66-45a0-bc61-9cdfca74abbf)

Therefore, the Z-parameters of a two port network are as follows

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a962555f-6f34-4350-9d54-b4786537e339)

All these parameters are also called open-circuit impedance parameters.
Z11 is known as the driving-point impedance at the input port, when output port is opencircuited.
Z21 is known as the transfer impedance at the input port, when output port is open-circuited.
Z22 is known as the driving-point impedance at the output port, when input port is opencircuited.
Z12 is known as the transfer impedance at the output port, when input port is open-circuited.

As these impedance parameters are measured with either the input or output port opencircuited, these are called open-circuit impedance parameters. The equivalent circuit of the two-port network in terms of Z parameters is shown

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc29b0da-d23a-4d67-8d8f-ba9d02009a32)

The network is to be reciprocal if Z12 = Z21
The network is to be symmetrical if Z11 = Z22

## SHORT-CIRCUIT ADMITTANCE PARAMETERS (or) Y-PARAMETERS
The admittance parameters are also called Y-parameters. To determine Y-parameters, V1 and V2 are taken as independent variables and I1 and I2 as dependent variables. Port currents I1 and I2 are expressed in terms of the voltages V1 and V2. The network equations are written as follows:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/538f0e5c-5edb-486e-b70f-e3d8f7f83d36)

The equations can be represented in matrix form as follows:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5fe2c97-0313-437c-854e-94094f727326)

where Y11, Y12, Y21 and Y22 are admittance parameters and these can be determined as in the following

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2d51aff-15d3-4925-8651-a0049aeacd5e)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a305503b-76f2-4700-8873-072236fe8e4b)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b31f634a-1eb9-4c15-aae7-a3511052457b)

As these admittance parameters are measured with either input or output port short-circuited, these are called short-circuit admittance parameters.
The equivalent circuit of the two-port network in terms of Y parameters is shown in Fig

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1a3ae37-4716-49ac-a56a-2e9d4d9f7aa3)

If the network is reciprocal if Y12 = Y21
If the network is symmetrical if Y11 = Y22

## ΤRANSMISSION PARAMETERS (or) ABCD PARAMETERS
The transmission parameters or chain parameters or ABCD parameters serve to relate the voltage and current at the input port to voltage and current at the output port.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0618897b-517b-4903-9f33-1a088d2fac40)

Here, the negative sign is used with I2 and not for parameters B and D. The reason the current I2 carries a negative sign is that in transmission field, the output current is assumed to be coming out of the output port instead of going into the port. In matrix form, we can write

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d69093d-6249-4bd5-9101-36c62f977d0f)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24fdfa51-c044-42c1-9624-b02b7a094acb)

The two-port parameters in above equations provide a measure of how a circuit transmits voltage and current from a source to a load. They are useful in the analysis of transmission lines (such as cable and fiber) because they express sending-end variables (V1 and I1) in terms of the receiving-end variables (V2 and ‒I2). For this reason, they are called transmission parameters. They are also known as ABCD parameters. They are used in the design of telephone systems, microwave networks, and radars.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8f3ffd9-12c0-4ede-8dd4-31536445f4f4)

Thus, the transmission parameters are called, specifically,
A = Open-circuit voltage ratio
B = Negative short-circuit transfer impedance
C = Open-circuit transfer admittance
D = Negative short-circuit current ratio
A and D are dimensionless, B is in ohms, and C is in siemens. Since the transmission parameters provide a direct relationship between input and output variables, they are very useful in cascaded networks.
The network is to be reciprocal if AD − BC = 1
The network is to be symmetrical if A = D

## INVERSE ΤRANSMISSION PARAMETERS (or) A’B’C’D’ PARAMETERS
The inverse transmission parameters serve to relate the voltage and current at the output port to the voltage and current at the input port.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a8bdc4f-e15c-4c57-88e3-7a98f9ddef21)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87f3d813-12c2-4090-b2b4-e254410e1cd9)

The network is to be reciprocal if A’D’ − B’C’ = 1
The network is to be symmetrical if A’ = D’

## HYBRID PARAMETERS (or) h - PARAMETERS
The hybrid parameters of a two-port network may be defined by expressing the voltage of input port V1 and current of output port I2 in terms of current of input port I1 and voltage of output port V2.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47d8762d-f242-44e1-8c02-370f75b588ce)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df4807f4-488b-406a-9c49-3e4e14d983a0)

The network is to be reciprocal if h12 = − h21
The network is to be symmetrical if h11 h22 − h12 h21 = 1

It is evident from Eq. that the parameters represent impedance, a voltage gain, a current gain, and admittance, respectively. Therefore, they are called the hybrid parameters.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f6b3dee-44a7-4746-b566-6f3165493380)

## INVERSE HYBRID PARAMETERS (or) g – PARAMETERS
The inverse hybrid parameters of a two-port network may be defined by expressing the current of the input port I1 and voltage of the output port V2 in terms of the voltage of the input port V1 and the current of the output port I2.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25f19364-7535-4f1f-8557-bbabb35318c6)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a159a461-9b0b-4a0b-a72c-0e017fbc41a7)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c15a4fc-6606-430d-bc3b-11011f19db15)

The network is to be reciprocal if g12 = − g 21
The network is to be symmetrical if g 11 g 22 − g 12 g 21 = 1

NOTE: Conditions for reciprocity and symmetry
