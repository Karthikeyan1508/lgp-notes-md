# Object Oriented Programming

Types of programming

1. Structured Programming
The instruction in this approach will be executed in a serial and structured manner.
The purpose of structured programming is to linearise control flow through a computer program so that the execution sequence follows the sequence in which the code is written.
The program uses single-entry and single-exit  formats.
The structured programming mainly consists of four types of elements:
Sequence Statements
Alternation/selection Statements
Iteration Statements
Nested Structure

2. Procedural Programming
The paradigm uses a linear top-down approach and treats data and procedures as two different entities.
To solve a large problem, procedural programming language divides the problem into smaller modules called functions or procedures each of which handles a particular responsibility. The  program which solves the entire problem is a collection of such functions.
It focuses on processes rather than data.
Adding new data and functions is not easy and most if the data is global and keeps floating between functions.

3. Object Oriented Programming
Organised around data, with the key principle being “data controlling access to code”
Data defines precisely what sort of operations can be applied to that data.
It focuses on data rather than processes.
Programs are divided into objects(resembling real-life entities).
Functions that operate on the same kind of data and tied together - encapsulation.
Data can be hidden from a specific portion of code - abstraction.
Objects can communicate with each other through functions.
