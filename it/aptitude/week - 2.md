# Quantitative Analysis - Part 2

## 1. Time, Speed, and Distance (TSD)

### Basic Formulas
- **Distance** = Speed × Time  
- **Speed** = Distance ÷ Time  
- **Time** = Distance ÷ Speed  

### Unit Conversions
- 1 km/hr = (5/18) m/s  
- 1 m/s = (18/5) km/hr  

### Average Speed
- **Equal Distance**:  
  Avg Speed = (2xy) / (x + y)
- **Equal Time**:  
  Avg Speed = (x + y) / 2

### Relative Speed
- **Same Direction**:  
  Relative Speed = |x − y|
- **Opposite Direction**:  
  Relative Speed = x + y

### Examples
- A car goes 60 km at 30 km/hr, returns at 60 km/hr:  
  Avg Speed = (2 × 30 × 60) / (30 + 60) = **40 km/hr**

- Convert 72 km/hr to m/s:  
  72 × (5/18) = **20 m/s**

- Two trains at 40 km/hr and 60 km/hr, opposite direction:  
  Relative Speed = 100 km/hr = **27.78 m/s**


## 2. Train Problems (Special TSD Cases)

### Crossing a Pole
- Time = Length of train / Speed

### Crossing a Platform
- Time = (Length of train + Platform) / Speed

### Crossing Another Train
- **Opposite Direction**:  
  Time = (L1 + L2) / (S1 + S2)
- **Same Direction**:  
  Time = (L1 + L2) / |S1 − S2|

### Examples
- Train 120m, Speed = 60 km/hr →  
  Time = 120 / 16.67 = **7.2 sec**

- Trains 100m and 150m at 60 and 90 km/hr (opposite):  
  Relative speed = 41.67 m/s →  
  Time = 250 / 41.67 ≈ **6 sec**


## 3. Simple Interest (SI)

### Formulas
- **SI** = (P × R × T) / 100  
- **Amount (A)** = P + SI  

### To Find:
- P = (SI × 100) / (R × T)  
- R = (SI × 100) / (P × T)  
- T = (SI × 100) / (P × R)

### Example
- P = ₹1000, R = 10%, T = 2 years:  
  SI = (1000 × 10 × 2) / 100 = **₹200**  
  Amount = 1000 + 200 = **₹1200**


## 4. Compound Interest (CI)

### Formula
- **A** = P (1 + R/100)^T  
- **CI** = A − P  

### Special Cases
- **Half-Yearly**:  
  A = P (1 + R/2×100)^(2T)

- **Quarterly**:  
  A = P (1 + R/4×100)^(4T)

- **CI - SI (2 years)**:  
  CI − SI = P (R/100)^2

### Example
- P = ₹1000, R = 10%, T = 2 yrs  
  A = 1000 × (1.1)^2 = **₹1210**  
  CI = **₹210**

- **Half-yearly**:  
  A = 1000 × (1.05)^4 = **₹1215.50**


## 5. Averages

### Formulas
- **Basic Average**:  
  Average = Sum of items / Number of items

- **New Average when one value changes or is added**:  
  New Sum = Old Sum + Change

- **Average Speed (equal time)**:  
  (x + y) / 2

- **Weighted Average**:  
  W.Avg = (w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + ... + wₙxₙ) / (w₁ + w₂ + ... + wₙ)

### Examples
- Average of 5, 7, 9:  
  Avg = 21 / 3 = **7**

- A student scores 80 in 4 subjects, needs average of 75.  
  Total needed = 75 × 5 = 375  
  Scored = 80 × 4 = 320 → Need **55** in 5th

- Weights and prices: 2 kg at ₹50, 3 kg at ₹60  
  Weighted Avg = (2×50 + 3×60) / (2 + 3) = **₹56**


## 6. Mixtures and Alligation

### Alligation Rule
Used to find the ratio of mixing two components of different values to obtain a desired average.

**Formula (Shortcut)**:  
Ratio = (x₂ − m) / (m − x₁)  
Where:  
- x₁, x₂ = values (e.g., price or concentration)  
- m = mean value of the mixture

### Replacement Formula
If a quantity is removed and replaced multiple times:  
**Final Quantity** = Q × (1 − r/Q)^n

### Examples
- Mix ₹10 and ₹15 to get ₹12:  
  Ratio = (15 − 12) / (12 − 10) = **3:2**

- 20L milk, 4L replaced with water twice:  
  Remaining milk = 20 × (0.8)^2 = **12.8L**
