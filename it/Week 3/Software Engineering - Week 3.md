# Version Control

**Version Control** is a system that records changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows multiple people to collaborate, track changes, and revert to previous states if necessary.

## Key Features

* Tracks file changes over time.
* Allows reverting to earlier versions of code or documents.
* Enables collaboration among multiple developers.
* Supports branching and merging, allowing parallel development.

## Types of Version Control

| Type                       | Description                                               |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local Version Control**  | Keeps track of file versions locally on your system.      |
| **Centralized VCS (CVCS)** | All versions are stored in a central server (e.g., SVN).  |
| **Distributed VCS (DVCS)** | Every user has a full copy of the repository (e.g., Git). |

---

## What is Git?

**Git** is a **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)** created by **Linus Torvalds** in 2005 for managing the development of the Linux kernel.

It is the most widely used version control system today and allows developers to work both offline and online.

## Characteristics of Git

* Distributed: Each user has a complete local copy of the repository.
* Fast and efficient: Operations like commits, diffs, and branches are quick.
* Secure: Uses SHA-1 hashing to track content.
* Supports non-linear development via branches and merges.

---

## Why Use Git?

### a. **Track Changes**

Git allows you to keep a history of all changes made to the project. You can go back to a previous state at any time.

### b. **Collaboration**

Multiple developers can work on the same project at the same time without interfering with each other’s work.

### c. **Branching and Merging**

You can create separate branches for features or bug fixes and merge them into the main branch when ready. This keeps the main codebase stable.

### d. **Distributed Workflow**

You can work offline because you have the full history of the project. Once you're online, you can sync changes with the remote repository.

### e. **Open Source and Widely Adopted**

Git is free and open-source. It is supported by many platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and more.

### f. **Security**

Git uses cryptographic methods (SHA-1) to ensure the integrity and authenticity of version history.

---

# Git Basics

Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of their projects.

## 1. `git init`

The `git init` command is used to create a new Git repository. This initializes a new `.git` directory in your project folder, allowing Git to begin tracking versions of files in that directory.

### Syntax:

```bash
git init
```

### Example:

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
git init
```

### What It Does:

* Creates a `.git` subdirectory which contains all of the necessary metadata for the repo.
* Sets the current directory as the working directory for Git.
* Does **not** add any files or make any commits yet.

## 2. `git clone`

The `git clone` command is used to create a copy of an existing remote repository on your local machine. This is typically how you start working on someone else's project or a remote repository you've created elsewhere.

### Syntax:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
```

### What It Does:

* Downloads the complete repository including its history.
* Automatically creates a new directory with the repo name.
* Sets up the `origin` remote pointing to the cloned URL.


## 3. `git add`

The `git add` command is used to stage changes. Staging means preparing the files you want to include in your next commit. You can add new files, modified files, or remove files from the staging area.

### Syntax:

```bash
git add <file-name>         # Stages a specific file
git add .                   # Stages all changes in the current directory
```

### Example:

```bash
git add index.html
git add .
```

### What It Does:

* Moves the changes to the staging area (also called the index).
* Git will only commit changes that have been added to the staging area.


## 4. `git commit`

The `git commit` command takes all the changes that have been staged and saves them in the repository's history. Each commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.

### Syntax:

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

### Example:

```bash
git commit -m "Add homepage layout"
```

### What It Does:

* Saves a snapshot of the staged changes.
* Records metadata (author, date, message, etc.).
* Does not include unstaged or untracked changes.


## 5. `git push`

The `git push` command is used to upload your local commits to a remote repository. This is how you share your work with others.

### Syntax:

```bash
git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
```

### Common Usage:

```bash
git push origin main
```

### What It Does:

* Sends committed changes to the specified remote branch.
* `origin` is usually the default name for the remote repository.
* You must have commit access and the branch must exist (or be created).


## 6. `git pull`

The `git pull` command is used to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository into your local repository. It’s a combination of `git fetch` followed by `git merge`.

### Syntax:

```bash
git pull <remote-name> <branch-name>
```

### Common Usage:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

### What It Does:

* Retrieves updates from the remote branch.
* Automatically merges them into your current branch.
* Helps keep your local repository up to date with team members’ work.

## Branching and Merging

Here are detailed **Markdown notes** on **Branching and Merging in Git**, covering what they are, why they're important, and how to use them.

---

# Branching and Merging in Git

---

## 1. What is Branching?

### Definition:

A **branch** in Git is a lightweight, movable pointer to a specific commit. It allows you to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment with new ideas **without affecting the main codebase** (usually the `main` or `master` branch).

### Why Use Branches?

* To work on new features without disturbing the stable version.
* To isolate bug fixes or experiments.
* To allow multiple developers to work independently.
* To support parallel development workflows.

### Default Branch:

When you initialize a Git repository, the default branch is usually called `main` (older repos may use `master`).

---

## 2. Creating and Switching Branches

### Create a New Branch:

```bash
git branch <branch-name>
```

Example:

```bash
git branch feature-login
```

### Switch to a Branch:

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

Example:

```bash
git checkout feature-login
```

### Combine Creation and Switching (Shortcut):

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-login
```

---

## 3. Viewing Branches

### List All Branches:

```bash
git branch
```

* The current branch will have an asterisk (`*`) next to it.

### View All Local and Remote Branches:

```bash
git branch -a
```

---

## 4. Merging Branches

### Definition:

**Merging** is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. Most commonly, you merge a feature branch back into the main branch after development is complete.

### Basic Merge Syntax:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge <branch-name>
```

Example:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-login
```

### What Happens During a Merge:

* Git integrates the changes from the specified branch into your current branch.
* If changes do not overlap, Git auto-merges them.
* If there are conflicts (i.e., the same lines were changed in both branches), Git will mark these and require manual resolution.

---

## 5. Merge Conflicts

### What is a Merge Conflict?

A **merge conflict** occurs when Git cannot automatically reconcile changes made to the same part of the same file in different branches.

### How to Resolve:

1. Open the conflicted files.
2. Manually edit the file to keep or modify conflicting changes.
3. Mark the conflict as resolved:

   ```bash
   git add <conflicted-file>
   ```
4. Complete the merge with:

   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

---

## 6. Deleting a Branch (After Merge)

Once a feature branch is merged, it’s often deleted to keep the repo clean.

### Delete Local Branch:

```bash
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

Example:

```bash
git branch -d feature-login
```

### Force Delete (if not merged):

```bash
git branch -D <branch-name>
```

## 8. Best Practices

* Name branches clearly, e.g., `feature/login`, `bugfix/header-crash`, `hotfix/payment-error`.
* Always pull the latest changes from the main branch before merging.
* Resolve merge conflicts immediately and carefully.
* Delete old branches after merging to keep the repository clean.

Here are **detailed markdown notes** focused specifically on **GitHub workflows**, covering:

* Pull Requests (PRs)
* Code Reviews
* Issues and Issue Tracking

These are essential for collaboration in team projects using GitHub.

---

# GitHub Workflows

## 1. Pull Requests (PRs)

### What is a Pull Request?

A **Pull Request (PR)** in GitHub is a way to propose changes you've made in a separate branch and request that those changes be reviewed and merged into another branch (usually `main` or `develop`).

It is a **core part of collaboration**, especially in teams, allowing structured reviews and automated checks before code becomes part of the main project.

### Typical Workflow:

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-login
   ```
2. **Make changes**, then:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add login feature"
   git push origin feature-login
   ```
3. Go to your GitHub repository and click on **"Compare & pull request"**.
4. Provide a title and description explaining your changes.
5. Submit the PR for review.

### PR Interface on GitHub:

* Shows a **diff view** of all changes.
* Allows reviewers to **comment on specific lines**.
* Can be connected to issues (e.g., “Fixes #23”).
* Shows **status checks** (e.g., CI/CD tests, linters).

### Merging Options:

* **Merge Commit**: Creates a merge commit.
* **Squash and Merge**: Combines all commits into one before merging.
* **Rebase and Merge**: Applies commits individually on top of the base branch.

## 2. Code Reviews

### What is a Code Review?

A **code review** is the process where team members examine the proposed changes in a pull request before merging them. This helps catch bugs, ensure code quality, and maintain consistency.

### GitHub Features for Code Reviews:

* **Commenting on lines of code**: Highlight and suggest changes.
* **Review Summary**:

  * `Comment`: Add feedback without approving.
  * `Approve`: Approve changes to be merged.
  * `Request changes`: Ask for improvements before merging.
* **Reviewers and Assignees**: PR authors can assign specific people to review the code.

### Benefits:

* Improves code quality and readability.
* Helps spread knowledge across the team.
* Encourages consistent practices and standards.


## 3. Issues and Issue Tracking

### What are GitHub Issues?

**Issues** are GitHub’s built-in way to track tasks, bugs, feature requests, and general project discussions.

### Creating an Issue:

* Go to the **"Issues"** tab in your repository.
* Click **"New Issue"**.
* Fill in the title and description.
* Optionally assign labels, assignees, and link to milestones or projects.

### Issue Features:

* **Labels**: Categorize issues (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`).
* **Assignees**: Assign team members responsible for the issue.
* **Milestones**: Track progress across multiple issues.
* **Projects**: Use Kanban-style boards to organize issues.
* **Linked PRs**: Use keywords like `Fixes #12` in PRs to automatically close issues when merged.

### Best Practices:

* Write clear, descriptive titles and steps to reproduce bugs.
* Link related issues and PRs.
* Use checklists for multi-step tasks.

# Team Collaboration with Git

## 1. Why Use Git for Team Collaboration?

Git enables multiple developers to **work on the same project simultaneously** without interfering with each other’s work. It provides:

* Version tracking for all code changes.
* Safe branching and merging for features and fixes.
* A full history of who made what changes and why.
* Tools for reviewing and managing contributions.


## 2. Typical Team Workflow (Feature Branch Workflow)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea9f4ac2-f6db-4f25-9aa1-ec4e484267f4)


### Step-by-Step Overview:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Every team member starts by cloning the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/org/project.git
   ```

2. **Create a New Branch for Each Task**
   Developers create a new branch for each feature or bug fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/user-auth
   ```

3. **Make Changes Locally**
   Add and commit code:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add user authentication feature"
   ```

4. **Pull the Latest Main Changes**
   Before pushing, sync with the latest changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout feature/user-auth
   git rebase main  # or git merge main
   ```

5. **Push the Branch to GitHub**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/user-auth
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub**
   Open a PR from `feature/user-auth` to `main` for review.

7. **Review and Merge**
   Other team members review the PR, suggest changes, and approve.
   Once approved, the branch is merged into `main`.
   

## 3. Roles in a Git-Enabled Team

| Role                | Responsibilities                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Contributor**     | Develops features, writes code, creates branches and PRs            |
| **Reviewer**        | Reviews pull requests, suggests changes, approves or requests edits |
| **Maintainer**      | Manages the main branch, merges PRs, manages releases               |
| **Project Manager** | Organizes tasks via Issues, Milestones, Projects, etc.              |

---

## 4. Collaboration Tools in Git & GitHub

### 1. **Branches**

* Used to isolate work and prevent conflicts.
* Feature branches (`feature/xyz`), bugfix branches (`bugfix/xyz`), etc.

### 2. **Pull Requests (PRs)**

* Proposed changes from one branch to another.
* Enables discussion, review, and CI/CD integration.

### 3. **Code Reviews**

* Team members review changes line-by-line.
* Improves code quality, catches bugs, and ensures consistency.

### 4. **Issues**

* Used to track bugs, feature requests, or tasks.
* Often linked with PRs (e.g., `Fixes #12`).

### 5. **Labels, Milestones, Projects**

* Organize work, track progress, and manage team contributions.



## 5. Handling Merge Conflicts in Teams

* Conflicts happen when two branches modify the same part of the same file.
* Resolve by editing the file manually and choosing which changes to keep.
* Mark the conflict as resolved:

  ```bash
  git add conflicted_file.js
  git commit
  ```

**Best Practice:** Frequently pull changes from `main` and rebase your branch to reduce conflicts.


## 6. Best Practices for Teams Using Git

* **One task = One branch = One PR**
* Use descriptive branch names: `feature/signup-form`, `bugfix/login-crash`
* Write meaningful commit messages:

  ```
  Good: "Fix login error on invalid credentials"
  Bad:  "fixed stuff"
  ```
* Always review and test before merging
* Keep your `main` branch clean and deployable
* Use `.gitignore` to avoid pushing local settings or secret files

# CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)

## What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Continuous Delivery). It is a set of practices used in modern software development to automate the process of integrating code changes, testing, and deploying applications. The goal of CI/CD is to enable faster, safer, and more reliable software delivery by minimizing manual steps and human error.

Continuous Integration (CI) refers to the practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository, usually several times a day. Each integration triggers an automated build process and test suite, ensuring that the new changes do not break existing functionality. This allows teams to identify and fix issues early in the development cycle.

Continuous Deployment (CD) builds on top of CI by automatically releasing the validated code to production or staging environments. When CD is configured properly, any change that passes all stages of the CI pipeline is automatically deployed. If deployment is automated only up to staging or testing environments (but requires manual approval for production), it is referred to as Continuous Delivery.

## Workflow of CI/CD

The CI/CD workflow typically begins when a developer pushes code changes to a version control system such as Git. This triggers the CI pipeline, which includes steps like checking out the code, installing dependencies, building the project, and running automated tests such as unit and integration tests. If the code passes all these tests, it moves on to the CD stage.

In Continuous Delivery, the validated code is packaged and made ready for deployment to a staging or QA environment where it can be tested further by human testers or automated end-to-end tests. In Continuous Deployment, this step is followed by an automatic push to the production environment without requiring manual intervention.

CI/CD pipelines are typically defined using configuration files in YAML or similar formats, depending on the tool being used (e.g., `.github/workflows` for GitHub Actions or `.gitlab-ci.yml` for GitLab CI).

## Benefits of CI/CD

One of the primary benefits of CI/CD is **faster delivery**. Since much of the integration, testing, and deployment process is automated, teams can release new features, bug fixes, and updates more frequently and with greater confidence. This allows organizations to respond quickly to user feedback and market changes.

Another significant benefit is **reduced risk**. Automated testing ensures that code is validated at every step, catching bugs early before they reach production. Smaller, more frequent changes are easier to test and debug, making the overall system more stable.

**Automated testing** is a cornerstone of CI/CD. It ensures that new changes do not break existing functionality and that all parts of the application are tested consistently. These tests can include unit tests, integration tests, static code analysis, and even security scans. With proper test coverage, developers are alerted to problems early, reducing the chance of costly bugs in production.

CI/CD also promotes **team collaboration**. Developers get immediate feedback on their changes, and teams can work together more efficiently knowing that the integration and deployment process is handled by a reliable, automated system. This leads to better communication, fewer conflicts, and a more productive development workflow.

## Popular Tools for CI/CD

There are several tools available for implementing CI/CD pipelines. GitHub Actions is widely used for projects hosted on GitHub and integrates seamlessly with GitHub repositories. It allows developers to define workflows that run on specific triggers, such as pushing to a branch or opening a pull request.

Other popular CI/CD tools include GitLab CI, Jenkins, Travis CI, and CircleCI. These tools offer varying levels of customization, integrations, and scalability depending on the project’s needs.

## Example: CI Workflow Using GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```

This configuration checks out the code, sets up the Node.js environment, installs dependencies, and runs tests whenever a commit is pushed to the main branch or a pull request is created. More steps can be added to deploy the application once the tests pass.
