# Competitive Programming Notes

Competitive programming involves solving algorithmic problems under constraints, with a focus on time and space efficiency. This plan covers the most frequent patterns seen in interviews and contests.

# Arrays & Strings

Arrays are the foundation of most problems. Key techniques include prefix sums, sliding windows, and two-pointer methods.

Strings require manipulation and understanding of memory and traversal, often used in problems like anagrams, palindromes, and pattern matching.

# Linked Lists

Linked Lists are crucial for understanding pointers and memory management.

Problems often focus on reversing, detecting cycles (Floydâ€™s Algorithm), and merging sorted lists.

# Trees

Tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order) is foundational.

Recursive thinking is key. Concepts like DFS/BFS, height calculation, and subtree comparison are core.

# Binary Search

A divide-and-conquer strategy that reduces time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

Variants include lower/upper bound, rotated arrays, and binary search on answers.

# Sliding Window

Useful for subarray problems where we track a range in linear time.

Often paired with hash maps for frequency/counting purposes.

# Two Pointers

Used when comparing or moving through two indexes in a single pass.

Excellent for problems involving sorting, merging, or partitioning.

# Stack

Used for Last-In-First-Out operations.

Important in parsing expressions, backtracking, and maintaining monotonic sequences.

# Heap / Priority Queue

Great for keeping track of min/max values dynamically.

Essential for scheduling, median-finding, and merging tasks.

# Graphs (BFS/DFS)

Graph traversal is critical. BFS is ideal for shortest paths, while DFS is useful for exploring components.

Topological sort, connected components, and cycle detection are key concepts.

# Dynamic Programming

Breaks a problem into subproblems and caches results to avoid recomputation.

Recognizing overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure is key.

# Trie / String Matching

Trie helps in dictionary-like problems and prefix searching.

Efficient for solving auto-complete and word search variations.

# Greedy

Makes local optimal choices at each step with the hope of a global optimum.

Works well in interval scheduling, coin problems, and path optimization.

# Backtracking

A brute-force approach with pruning.
Often used in permutations, combinations, and constraint-satisfying problems.
