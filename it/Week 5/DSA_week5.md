# Competitive Programming Notes

Competitive programming involves solving algorithmic problems under constraints, with a focus on time and space efficiency. It emphasizes writing correct, optimal solutions within a limited time. This plan covers the most frequent patterns seen in interviews and contests, including algorithmic design, data structure mastery, and problem-solving strategies. These notes are written to help students grasp core ideas and sense how each concept contributes to efficient problem-solving.

# Arrays & Strings

Arrays are fundamental because they provide indexed access to a collection of elements. You'll encounter problems like finding subarrays with certain properties or manipulating elements in place.

* **Prefix Sum**: Build an array where each position holds the sum of all previous elements. Helps in constant-time subarray sum queries.
* **Sliding Window**: Move a fixed-size or dynamic-size window through an array to track or optimize subarray properties (sum, count, etc.).
* **Two Pointers**: Efficient for sorted arrays to perform linear-time comparisons.

Strings, though similar to arrays, often deal with character frequency, pattern detection, and transformation:

* **Character Frequency**: Helps in checking anagrams or counting specific letters.
* **String Matching**: Brute force methods are slow; advanced techniques (KMP, Rabin-Karp) improve performance.
* **Palindrome Checking**: Often involves comparing characters symmetrically or using dynamic programming.

---

# Linked Lists

Linked Lists are dynamic structures where elements point to the next. Useful in situations requiring constant-time insertions/deletions.

* **Reversing a List**: Core pointer manipulation skill.
* **Cycle Detection**: Detect loops using two pointers moving at different speeds.
* **Middle of List**: Fast-slow pointer trick helps find the middle node efficiently.
* **Merge Sorted Lists**: Requires careful pointer adjustments, especially in recursive formats.

Linked lists also build intuition for handling nulls, pointers, and edge cases.

---

# Trees

Trees represent hierarchical structures. Binary trees are the most tested form.

* **Traversals**: Pre-order (process before children), In-order (for BSTs: sorted output), Post-order (process children before node).
* **Level Order (BFS)**: Uses queues to explore nodes level by level.
* **BST Properties**: Left subtree < Node < Right subtree; useful in search and sorting.
* **Path-Based Problems**: Like max sum from root to leaf, or diameter between nodes.

Recursive and stack-based approaches often apply here.

---

# Binary Search

An essential divide-and-conquer technique, applied to sorted data or monotonic functions.

* **Standard Search**: Finds an element in log(n) time.
* **Rotated Arrays**: Binary search can adapt to rotated sorted inputs.
* **Search on Answer**: Instead of a concrete array, you search the *range* of values.

Understanding when to move the left/right pointers is crucial.

---

# Sliding Window

Used to optimize problems involving contiguous subarrays.

* **Fixed Window**: For problems where size is fixed (e.g., max sum of size k).
* **Dynamic Window**: Useful for problems like longest substring without repeating characters.
* **Hash Maps**: Often used to track frequencies in a window.

Requires careful start/end pointer management to expand and shrink windows.

---

# Two Pointers

Two indices move independently or together to achieve the goal.

* **In-Place Operations**: Like removing duplicates.
* **Sorted Array Use**: Merging, searching pairs, or triplets.
* **Partitioning**: Grouping values below and above a pivot.

Commonly appears in combination with sorting or greedy strategies.

---

# Stack

Stacks hold data in LIFO order. They're useful when the most recent item is needed next.

* **Monotonic Stack**: Maintains increasing or decreasing order for solving range maximum/minimum problems.
* **Expression Evaluation**: Converts infix to postfix or handles parenthesis evaluation.
* **Simulating Recursion**: Non-recursive DFS and backtracking.

Also used in problems like stock span, histogram area, etc.

---

# Heap / Priority Queue

A special tree-based structure to efficiently get min or max elements.

* **Min Heap**: Used in Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm and finding smallest values.
* **Kth Largest/Smallest**: Maintain a heap of size k for efficiency.
* **Merging Sorted Lists**: Heaps help in merging efficiently.

Good for scenarios with dynamically updating streams.

---

# Graphs (BFS/DFS)

Graphs model relationships and connections. Traversals help explore or analyze such structures.

* **DFS**: Goes deep before backtracking. Useful in components and cycle detection.
* **BFS**: Explores level by level. Best for shortest path in unweighted graphs.
* **Topological Sort**: Orders tasks with dependencies (DAGs).
* **Connected Components**: Group all reachable nodes.

Know how to represent graphs using adjacency lists or matrices.

---

# Dynamic Programming

DP is used to solve problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

* **Memoization**: Save results of recursive calls to avoid recomputation.
* **Tabulation**: Iterative bottom-up approach.
* **State Identification**: Define what each subproblem represents.

Useful in problems like:

* **Knapsack**: Max value under weight constraint.
* **Subsequences**: LCS, LIS, etc.
* **Partitioning**: Divide arrays under rules.

Understanding transitions is critical to mastering DP.

---

# Trie / String Matching

Trie is a tree where nodes represent prefixes.

* **Auto-complete**: Suggest words based on prefix.
* **Validation**: Check if word exists in a set efficiently.
* **Word Search**: In 2D grids, using Trie reduces time.

String matching also includes:

* **KMP**: Avoids redundant comparisons.
* **Aho-Corasick**: For multiple pattern matching.

Great for dictionary-based problems.

---

# Greedy

Greedy algorithms build up a solution piece by piece by choosing the best local option.

* **Activity Selection**: Choose max non-overlapping intervals.
* **Huffman Encoding**: Build optimal prefix codes.
* **Fractional Knapsack**: Take the best density items first.

Requires proving that local choices lead to global optimality.

---

# Backtracking

Explores all possibilities by choosing an option and reverting if needed.

* **Permutations/Combinations**: Try placing one element at a time.
* **Sudoku Solver**: Try filling numbers with constraints.
* **N-Queens**: Place queens without attacking each other.

Key is to prune branches that are guaranteed to fail.
