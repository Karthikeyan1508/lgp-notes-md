Disk Scheduling in Operating Systems

Disk scheduling algorithms play a vital role in managing how data is read from and written to a computer’s hard disk. These algorithms determine the order of disk I/O (Input/Output) requests, directly affecting system performance, data retrieval speed, and overall efficiency.

What is Disk Scheduling?

Disk Scheduling, also known as I/O Scheduling, is a technique used by the Operating System to decide the sequence in which I/O requests are serviced by the disk controller. Since only one request can be processed at a time, others must wait in a queue. Efficient scheduling ensures minimum wait time, reduced disk arm movement, and faster data access.

Importance of Disk Scheduling
	•	Multiple I/O requests may arrive simultaneously from different processes, and the disk can handle only one at a time.
	•	Requests might be far apart on the disk, leading to large disk arm movements (high seek time).
	•	Hard drives are relatively slow compared to other components, making optimization critical.
	•	Proper disk scheduling improves:
	•	Data retrieval speed
	•	System responsiveness
	•	Overall throughput
