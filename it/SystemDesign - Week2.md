# System Architectural Styles

Monolithic architecture is a traditional approach to software design where all the functionalities of an application are packaged together into a single executable or deployable unit. It means that the user interface, server-side logic, and data access layers are part of the same codebase and run as a single process.

> For example, in a monolithic e-commerce application, the product catalog, user authentication, payment system, and order management are all part of one application.


## Structure of a Monolithic Application

A typical monolithic application consists of three main layers:

* **Presentation Layer (UI):** Handles user interactions, such as web pages or mobile UI.
* **Business Logic Layer:** Processes user inputs and makes logical decisions (e.g., validating a purchase).
* **Data Access Layer:** Manages communication with the database.

All these layers are tightly integrated and deployed together.

### Key Characteristics

* **Single Codebase:** The entire application is written and maintained in one code repository.
* **Tight Coupling:** Modules are heavily dependent on each other, making separation difficult.
* **Unified Deployment:** The entire application is deployed at once; even small changes require full redeployment.
* **Shared Resources:** All modules share the same memory, storage, and database connection.


### Advantages of Monolithic Architecture

**a. Simple Development**

Developers only need to understand one codebase and one set of technologies. It’s easier for new team members to onboard.

**b. Easy Testing**

Since everything is in one application, integration and end-to-end testing are simpler. Unit tests can be run without mocking external services.

**c. Straightforward Deployment**

There’s only one artifact (e.g., a `.jar`, `.war`, or Docker image) to deploy, making CI/CD pipelines simpler.

**d. Better Performance (Initially)**

There’s no network overhead between services since all components run in the same process. Function calls are faster than inter-service communication.

### Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture

**a. Scalability Challenges**

If only one part of the application (e.g., payment processing) needs more resources, you still have to scale the entire application, which is resource-inefficient.

**b. Limited Flexibility**

You are usually locked into one technology stack. Refactoring to another language or framework for just one module is hard.

**c. Risky Deployments**

A small bug in one module (like the search feature) can bring down the entire system, since everything is deployed together.

**d. Hard to Maintain**

As the codebase grows, understanding and maintaining it becomes more difficult. Over time, it turns into a **“big ball of mud.”**

**e. Slow Development Speed**

In large teams, developers working on different features may often conflict due to shared dependencies or functions.


### When to Use Monolithic Architecture?

Monolithic architecture is not always bad. It’s **suitable in certain scenarios**, such as:

* **Small or Medium-sized Applications:** Applications with limited business logic and few developers.
* **Startups or MVPs:** Ideal for building a Minimum Viable Product quickly to validate an idea.
* **Tight Deadlines:** Faster to develop and launch compared to microservices.
* **Simple Scaling Needs:** If the app doesn’t need to scale individual features, monolith works well.

### Challenges at Scale

As the application and team grow, the monolith faces several scaling issues:

* **Code Entanglement:** Hard to isolate features for debugging or upgrades.
* **Slow Builds:** Build and deployment times increase significantly.
* **Team Bottlenecks:** Multiple developers working in the same codebase can block each other.
* **Technology Stagnation:** You can't use different technologies for different modules.

This is often when teams consider **splitting the monolith into microservices.**
