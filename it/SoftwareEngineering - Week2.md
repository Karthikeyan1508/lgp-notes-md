# Agile Methodology

Agile Methodology is a way to manage projects by breaking them into smaller parts. It focuses on working together and making constant improvements. Teams plan, work on the project, and then review how things are going in a repeating cycle. They prioritize flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction.
- Major companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon use Agile because of its adaptability and customer-focused approach.

## Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto is a set of foundational principles for agile software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It Outlines 4 core Values and 12 Principles guide agile practices.

### Core Values

1. Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools: Focuses on the importance of effective communication and collaboration among team members.
2. Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation: Prioritizes the delivery of functional software as the primary measure of progress.
3. Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation: Encourages customers and stakeholders to have active involvement throughout the development process.
4. Responding to Change over Following a Plan: On changing requirements, embracing flexibility and ability to adapt even late in the development process.

### Principles

1. **Customer Satisfaction through Early and Continuous Delivery:** This principle concentrates on the importance of customer satisfaction by providing information to customers early on time and also with consistency throughout the development process.
2. **Welcome Changing Requirements, Even Late in Development:** Agile processes tackle change for the customer's competitive advantage. Even late in development, changes in requirements are welcomed to ensure the delivered software meets the evolving requirements of the customer.
3. **Deliver Working Software Frequently:** This principle encourages the regular release of functional software increments in short iterations. This enables faster feedback and adaptation to changing requirements.
4. **Collaboration between Business Stakeholders and Developers:** This says the businesspeople and developers must work together daily throughout the project. There should be communication and collaboration between stakeholders and the development team regularly. This is crucial for understanding and prioritizing requirements effectively.
5. **Build Projects around Motivated Individuals:** This promotes in giving developers the environment and support they need and trusts them to complete the job successfully. Motivated and empowered individuals are more likely to produce work with quality and make valuable contributions to the project.
6. **Face-to-face communication is the Most Effective:** Face-to-face communication is the most effective method of discussion and conveying information. This principle depicts the importance of direct interaction which helps minimize misunderstandings, and hence effective communication is achieved.
7. **Working Software is the Primary Measure of Progress:** This principle emphasizes delivering functional and working software as the primary metric for project advancement. It encourages teams to prioritize the continuous delivery of valuable features, so it ensures that good progress is consistently achieved throughout the process. The primary goal is to provide customers with incremental value and also gather feedback early in the project life cycle.
8. **Maintain a Sustainable Pace of Work:** Agile promotes sustainable development. All people involved: The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. This principle depicts the need for a sustainable and consistent development pace. This helps in avoiding burnout and ensures long-term project success.
9. **Continuous Attention to Technical Excellence and Good design:** This principle is on the importance of maintaining high standards of technical craft and design, so it ensures the long-term ability in maintenance and adaptability of the software.
10. **Simplicity—the Art of Maximizing the Amount of Work Not Done:** Simplicity is essential. The objective here is to concentrate on the most valuable features and tasks and avoid unnecessary complexity as the art of maximizing the amount of work not done is crucial.
11. **Self-Organizing Teams:** Self-organizing teams provide the best architectures, requirements, and designs. These help in empowering teams to make decisions and organize to optimize efficiency and creativity.
12. **Regular Reflection on Team Effectiveness:** This makes the team reflect on how to become more effective at regular intervals and then adjust accordingly. Continuous improvement is very crucial for adapting to changing circumstances and optimizing the team's performance over time.

## Types of Agile Methodologies

Agile is a flexible framework with several approaches, each suited for different project needs. Here are some of the most common Agile methodologies:

### Kanban

If Agile has a grandfather, Kanban is it. Initially developed by Toyota in the 1940s, Kanban revolutionized manufacturing and workflow management.

**How Kanban Influenced Agile:**

- Visualizing Workflows: Kanban introduced real-time task tracking, reducing bottlenecks.
- Continuous Improvement: It focused on incremental changes rather than big-bang transformations.
- Efficiency Through Flow: Limiting work-in-progress (WIP) improved delivery speed and minimized waste.

Today, Kanban remains a key player in the list of agile methodologies. It enables companies to manage workflows dynamically while maintaining adaptability. It has seamlessly integrated into various agile methodologies, making it a core part of agile framework types used in software development and business operations.

### 2. Incremental and Iterative Development (IID)

Before Scrum and SAFe, there was Incremental and Iterative Development (IID)—a method that dates back to the 1950s and 1960s in software engineering and military systems. IID laid the groundwork for all types of agile software development.

**How IID Shaped Agile Framework Types:**

- Breaking Work into Small Pieces: IID introduced early feedback loops, refining the product at each step.
- Parallel Development: Teams worked in short iterations, improving productivity and reducing risk.
- Customer-Centric Approach: Unlike waterfall methods, IID enabled continuous user feedback, ensuring that end products met expectations.

IID directly inspired Scrum, XP, and other agile methodologies, reinforcing the benefits of agile development methodology by delivering value faster and improving software reliability.

### 3. Spiral Model
Barry Boehm introduced the spiral model in the 1980s. It blended iterative development with risk analysis, a concept central to today’s types of agile development.

**Spiral Model’s Influence on Agile:**

- Risk-Driven Approach: Agile inherited the Spiral Model’s emphasis on frequent reassessment and adaptation.
- Prototyping: Early software versions were tested before full-scale development, a key principle in different agile methodologies.
- Customer Collaboration: Continuous stakeholder engagement met evolving business needs.

Many agile framework types, such as SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) and Disciplined Agile, have roots in the Spiral Model’s principles.

### 4. Lean Software Development
Lean Software Development guided efficiency-driven projects long before agile software development became a buzzword. Inspired by Lean Manufacturing, this approach emphasized waste reduction, continuous delivery, and customer value.

**Lean’s Contribution to Agile:**
- Eliminate Waste: Prioritize only value-driven tasks, optimizing time and resources.
- Enabling Teams: Encourage collaborative decision-making, now a hallmark of all types of agile methods.
- Fast Delivery: Deliver working software early and often, reinforcing the benefits of agile development methodology.

The types of agile methodology we use today—especially Kanban and SAFe—draw heavily from Lean’s principles.

### 5. Extreme Programming (XP)
XP emerged in the late 1990s, right before the Agile Manifesto. Unlike traditional methods, XP prioritized rapid releases, customer involvement, and technical excellence—all vital in today’s types of agile software development.

**How XP Revolutionized Agile Framework Types:**
- Test-Driven Development (TDD): Ensuring code quality through continuous testing and iteration.
- Pair Programming: Strengthening collaboration, now a staple in different agile methodologies.
- Frequent Releases: Delivering value every 1-2 weeks, reinforcing the benefits of agile development methodology.

Today, Scrum, SAFe, and DevOps integrate XP’s principles, demonstrating what agile methodologies are all about—speed, collaboration, and quality.
