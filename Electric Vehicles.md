# Electric vehicles

Electric vehicles (EVs) are automobiles powered entirely or partially by electricity. Instead of an internal combustion engine (ICE) that burns fuel (like petrol or diesel), EVs use electric motors and are powered by rechargeable batteries.

## Types of Electric Vehicles
Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)
Fully electric; no fuel engine
Examples: Tesla Model 3, Nissan Leaf

Needs charging through an electric outlet or charging station
Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)

Combines a petrol/diesel engine with an electric motor
Can run on electric power alone for a limited range
Example: Toyota Prius Plug-in

Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV)
No plug-in; charges through regenerative braking and engine
Electric motor assists the engine for better fuel economy
Example: Toyota Camry Hybrid

### Key Components of EVs
Electric Motor – Drives the vehicle using electrical energy
Battery Pack – Stores energy (typically Lithium-ion)
Inverter – Converts DC from the battery into AC for the motor
Charging Port – Connects the vehicle to an external power supply
Controller – Manages power delivery to the motor

 ### Advantages of EVs
Zero tailpipe emissions (BEVs)
Lower operating cost (electricity vs. fuel)
Quiet operation
Lower maintenance (fewer moving parts)
Energy-efficient (more of the input energy moves the vehicle)

### Challenges of EVs
Higher upfront cost (though decreasing)
Limited charging infrastructure (in some areas)
Range anxiety (fear of running out of battery)
Longer charging times than refueling with fuel
Battery degradation over time

# Vehicle Dynamics

Vehicle dynamics is the study of how vehicles move, considering forces, motions, and interactions between different vehicle components and the road surface. It helps in understanding and improving handling, ride comfort, stability, and safety.

 ### Main Aspects of Vehicle Dynamics
Longitudinal Dynamics
Motion along the length of the vehicle (forward/backward)

### Involves:
Acceleration / braking
Traction / drag forces
Weight transfer during acceleration or braking
Lateral Dynamics
Motion side to side (cornering behavior)

### Involves:
Steering
Cornering forces (centripetal force)
Slip angle and lateral acceleration
Understeer / oversteer
Vertical Dynamics
Up-and-down motion (suspension response)

### Involves:
Ride comfort
Bumps and road irregularities
Damping and spring stiffness

 ### Key Components Affecting Dynamics
Tires: Grip, slip angle, rolling resistance
Suspension System: Springs, dampers, anti-roll bars
Steering System: Rack & pinion, power steering
Chassis: Frame stiffness, weight distribution
Brakes and Drivetrain: Affect traction and weight transfer

 ### Important Terms
Term	Description
Slip Ratio	Difference between wheel rotational speed and actual speed
Yaw	Rotation around the vertical axis (steering movement)
Roll	Vehicle tilting sideways (cornering)
Pitch	Vehicle tilting forward/backward (braking/acceleration)
Understeer	Front wheels lose grip before rear (vehicle turns less than expected)
Oversteer	Rear wheels lose grip before front (vehicle turns more than expected)
Neutral Steer	Balanced steering behavior

### Vehicle Modeling in Dynamics
Bicycle Model: Simplified 2-wheel model used for steering and handling analysis.
Quarter Car Model: Used to analyze vertical dynamics (1 wheel + suspension).
Full Vehicle Model: All 4 wheels + complete suspension & body mass considered.

### Applications of Vehicle Dynamics
Vehicle stability systems (ABS, ESC, TCS)
Motorsport performance tuning
Autonomous vehicle control
Ride and handling improvement
Crash simulation and safety testing

# Fundamentals of EV Battery Pack desing

### Packaging and Layout
Cylindrical, Pouch, Prismatic cell types influence size and design
Modules often arranged in layers or stacks
Pack must meet:
Crashworthiness (impact resistance)
Weight optimization
Easy maintainability

 ### Design Standards and Testing
ISO 26262 – Functional safety
UN 38.3 – Transport safety of lithium batteries
IEC 62660 – Battery performance testing
