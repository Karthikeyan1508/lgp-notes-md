# Additive Manufacturing

Additive Manufacturing (AM) refers to a process by which digital 3D design data is used to build up a component in layers by depositing material

Additive Manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, is a process of creating a physical object from a digital design by laying down successive layers of material. Unlike traditional subtractive manufacturing methods, AM adds material only where needed, enabling complex designs and efficient production.

## Types of Additive Manufacturing

1. FDM – Melts and extrudes plastic filament.
2. SLA – Uses laser to cure liquid resin.
DLP – Similar to SLA, but uses a projector.
SLS – Fuses powdered material with a laser.
EBM – Uses electron beam in vacuum for metals.
Binder Jetting – Glues powder particles layer by layer.

### Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)
FDM is one of the most widely used additive manufacturing technologies, especially for prototyping and low-volume production.

### Working Principle:
A thermoplastic filament (like PLA, ABS, PETG) is fed into a heated extrusion head, where it is melted and then deposited layer by layer onto a build platform following the digital model.

### Materials Used:
- PLA (Polylactic Acid)
-ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)
-PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol)
-TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane)
-Nylon

### Applications:
-Rapid prototyping
-Concept models
-Functional parts (limited use due to lower strength and surface finish)

### Advantages:
-Low cost
-Simple to operate
-Widely available materials

### Limitations:
-Lower resolution and surface finish compared to other methods
-Limited material strength and heat resistance
-Visible layer lines

### Stereolithography (SLA)

SLA is one of the earliest and most precise additive manufacturing technologies, known for its high resolution and smooth surface finish.

### Working Principle:
A UV laser selectively cures (solidifies) a liquid photopolymer resin in a vat layer by layer. The build platform either moves up or down to allow the next layer to be cured.

### Materials Used:
-Photopolymer resins (standard, tough, flexible, castable, dental, etc.)

### Applications:
-Highly detailed prototypes
-Dental and medical models
-Jewelry casting patterns
-Mold masters for silicone molding

### Advantages:
-High dimensional accuracy
-Very fine detail and smooth surface finish
-Suitable for intricate designs

### Limitations:
-Resin can be brittle
-Parts may degrade under UV light over time
-Post-processing (cleaning and UV curing) is required

### Digital Light Processing (DLP)
DLP is similar to SLA but uses a digital light projector screen instead of a laser to cure photopolymer resin.

### Working Principle:
A digital projector flashes entire layers of light onto the resin surface at once, curing each layer in one shot (instead of tracing with a laser like SLA). This makes DLP faster than SLA for many prints.

### Materials Used:
-UV-sensitive liquid resins (similar to SLA resins)

### Applications:
-Dental models
-Jewelry
-Miniatures and figurines
-High-detail prototypes

### Advantages:
-Faster print speeds (entire layer cured at once)
-High resolution and surface quality
-Good for small, detailed parts

### Limitations:
-Limited build size
-Resin can be brittle
-Post-processing required (cleaning and final curing)

### Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)
SLS uses a high-powered laser to fuse powdered material layer by layer into a solid structure.

### Working Principle:
A laser scans and sinters (heats without melting) powder particles on a bed. After each layer is sintered, a new layer of powder is spread, and the process repeats. The unsintered powder acts as a natural support structure.

### Materials Used:
-Nylon (PA12, PA11)
-Thermoplastics

### Applications:
-Functional prototypes
-Low-volume production parts
-Aerospace and automotive components
-Medical devices

### Advantages:
-No support structures needed
-Strong, functional parts
-Complex geometries easily achievable
-Good mechanical properties

### Limitations:
-Surface finish is grainy
-Post-processing needed (cleaning, smoothing)
-Equipment and materials can be costly

### Electron Beam Melting (EBM)
EBM is a metal additive manufacturing process that uses a high-energy electron beam to fully melt metal powder inside a vacuum chamber.

### Working Principle:
A focused electron beam scans over a layer of metal powder, completely melting it to form each solid layer. The process occurs in a vacuum to prevent oxidation and ensure high-quality parts.

### Materials Used:
-Titanium and its alloys (e.g., Ti-6Al-4V)
-Cobalt-chrome alloys
-Nickel-based superalloys

### Applications:
-Aerospace components
-Medical implants (especially orthopedic and dental)
-High-performance engineering parts

### Advantages:
-Fully dense, strong metal parts
-Good for complex geometries
-Vacuum environment reduces contamination
-Excellent material properties

### Limitations:
-Expensive equipment
-Limited material selection (mostly titanium alloys)
-Rough surface finish (post-processing usually required)
-Slower than some other metal AM methods

### Binder Jetting – Glues powder particles layer by layer.

Binder Jetting is an additive manufacturing (3D printing) process in which a liquid binding agent (glue) is selectively deposited onto a powder bed, bonding the powder particles together layer by layer to form a solid part.

### Key Characteristics:
-Materials Used: Typically includes metal powders, ceramics, and sand.
-Binder: Usually a liquid glue or polymer sprayed through inkjet nozzles.
-No melting: Unlike processes like SLS or DMLS, Binder Jetting does not involve melting the material.

### Process Steps:
-Powder spreading: A thin layer of powder is spread over the build platform.
-Binder deposition: Inkjet printheads deposit binder selectively to form a layer of the part.
-Layering: The platform lowers, a new layer of powder is spread, and the process repeats.
-Curing (optional): Some systems use heat or other methods to solidify the binder.

### Post-processing:
-For metal parts, the green part is often sintered or infiltrated to improve strength.
-For sand molds, the part may be used directly in casting processes.

### Advantages:
-No support structures needed (the powder bed supports the part).
-Can produce complex geometries and large parts.
-Suitable for multi-material and full-color printing.

### Limitations:
-Parts are initially weak (green parts) and require post-processing.
-Lower mechanical strength compared to fully dense parts made by other methods.
-Surface finish and resolution can be rough compared to other 3D printing methods.
