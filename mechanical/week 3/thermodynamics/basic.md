# UNIT I - Fundamentals of Thermodynamics
## Thermodynamics: 
Thermodynamics is an axiomatic science which deals with the relations among heat, work and 
properties of system which are in equilibrium. It describes state and changes in state of 
physical systems. 
## System: 
A thermodynamic system is defined as a quantity of matter or a region in space which is 
selected for the study. 
## Surroundings: 
The mass or region outside the system is called surroundings. 
## Boundary: 
The real or imaginary surfaces which separates the system and surroundings is called 
boundary. The real or imaginary surfaces which separates the system and surroundings is 
called boundary.

## Types of thermodynamic system 
On the basis of mass and energy transfer the thermodynamic system is divided into three 
types. 
1. Closed system 
2. Open system 
3. Isolated system

## Closed system:
A system in which the transfer of energy but not mass can takes place across 
the boundary is called closed system. The mass inside the closed system remains constant. 
For example: Boiling of water in a closed vessel. Since the water is boiled in closed vessel so 
the mass of water cannot escapes out of the boundary of the system but heat energy 
continuously entering and leaving the boundary of the vessel. It is an example of closed 
system. 
## Open system:
A system in which the transfer of both mass and energy takes place is called 
an open system. This system is also known as control volume. 
For example: Boiling of water in an open vessel is an example of open system because the 
water and heat energy both enters and leaves the boundary of the vessel. 
## Isolated system: 
A system in which the transfer of mass and energy cannot takes place is 
called an isolated system. 
For example: Tea present in a thermos flask. In this the heat and the mass of the tea cannot 
cross the boundary of the thermos flask. Hence the thermos flak is an isolated system. 
## Control Volume: 
1 It’s a system of fixed volume.

2 This type of system is usually referred to as "open system” or a "control volume" 

3 Mass transfer can take place across a control volume.

4 Energy transfer may also occur into or out of the system.

5 Control Surface- It’s the boundary of a control volume across which the transfer of 
both mass and energy takes place.

6 The mass of a control volume (open system) may or may not be fixed. 

7 When the net influx of mass across the control surface equals zero then the mass of 
the system is fixed and vice-versa. 

8 The identity of mass in a control volume always changes unlike the case for a control 
mass system (closed system). 

9 Most of the engineering devices, in general, represent an open system or control  
volume.

## Example: 
Heat exchanger - Fluid enters and leaves the system continuously with the transfer of heat 
across the system boundary. 

Pump - A continuous flow of fluid takes place through the system with a transfer of mechanical 
energy from the surroundings to the system.  

Microscopic View or Study: 

1 The approach considers that the system is made up of a very large number of 
discrete particles known as molecules. These molecules have different velocities are 
energies. The values of these energies are constantly changing with time. This 
approach to thermodynamics, which is concerned directly with the structure of the 
matter, is known as statistical thermodynamics. 

2 The behavior of the system is found by using statistical methods, as the number of 
molecules is very large. So advanced statistical and mathematical methods are 
needed to explain the changes in the system. 

3 The properties like velocity, momentum, impulse, kinetic energy and instruments 
cannot easily measure force of impact etc. that describe the molecule. 

4 Large numbers of variables are needed to describe a system. So the approach is 
complicated.

Macroscopic View or Study: 

1 In this approach a certain quantity of matter is considered without taking into 
account the events occurring at molecular level. In other words this approach to 
thermodynamics is concerned with gross or overall behavior. This is known as 
classical thermodynamics.

2 The analysis of macroscopic system requires simple mathematical formula. 

3 The value of the properties of the system are their average values. For examples 
consider a sample of gas in a closed container. The pressure of the gas is the average 
value of the pressure exerted by millions of individual molecules. 

4 In order to describe a system only a few properties are needed.

## Thermodynamic Equilibrium: 

A thermodynamic system is said to exist in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium when no 
change in any macroscopic property is registered if the system is isolated from its 
surroundings.

An isolated system always reaches in the course of time a state of thermodynamic 
equilibrium and can never depart from it spontaneously. 
Therefore, there can be no spontaneous change in any macroscopic property if the system 
exists in an equilibrium state. A thermodynamic system will be in a state of thermodynamic 
equilibrium if the system is the state of Mechanical equilibrium, Chemical equilibrium and 
Thermal equilibrium. 

1. Mechanical equilibrium: The criteria for Mechanical equilibrium are the equality of 
pressures.

2. Chemical equilibrium: The criteria for Chemical equilibrium are the equality of 
chemical potentials.

3. Thermal equilibrium: The criterion for Thermal equilibrium is the equality of 
temperatures.
 
## State: 
The thermodynamic state of a system is defined by specifying values of a set of measurable 
properties sufficient to determine all other properties. For fluid systems, typical properties 
are pressure, volume and temperature. More complex systems may require the 
specification of more unusual properties. As an example, the state of an electric battery 
requires the specification of the amount of electric charge it contains. 

## Property: 

1. Properties may be extensive or intensive.

2. Intensive properties:
 The properties which are independent of the mass of 
thesystem. For example: Temperature, pressure and density are the intensive 
properties.

3. Extensive properties:
 The properties which depend on the size or extent of the 
system are called extensive properties.
 
 For example: Total mass, total volume and total momentum.

## Process: 
When the system undergoes change from one thermodynamic state to final state due 
change in properties like temperature, pressure, volume etc, the system is said to have 
undergone thermodynamic process. 
Various types of thermodynamic processes are: isothermal process, adiabatic process, 
isochoric process, isobaric process and reversible process. 

## Cycle: 
Thermodynamic cycle refers to any closed system that undergoes various changes due to 
temperature, pressure, and volume, however, its final and initial state are equal. This cycle is 
important as it allows for the continuous process of a moving piston seen in heat engines 
and the expansion/compression of the working fluid in refrigerators, for example. Without 
the cyclical process, a car wouldn't be able to continuously move when fuel is added, or a 
refrigerator would not be able to stay cold. Visually, any thermodynamic cycle will appear as 
a closed loop on a pressure volume diagram. 

Examples: Otto cycle, Diesel Cycle, Brayton Cycle etc. 

## Reversibility: 
Reversibility, in thermodynamics, a characteristic of certain processes (changes of a system 
from an initial state to a final state spontaneously or as a result of interactions with other 
systems) that can be reversed, and the system restored to its initial state, without leaving 
net effects in any of the systems involved. 
An example of a reversible process would be a single swing of a frictionless pendulum from 
one of its extreme positions to the other. The swing of a real pendulum is irreversible 
because a small amount of the mechanical energy of the pendulum would be expended in 
performing work against frictional forces, and restoration of the pendulum to its exact 
starting position would require the supply of an equivalent amount of energy from a second 
system, such as a compressed spring in which an irreversible change of state would occur. 

## Quasi static process: 
When a process is processing in such a way that system will be remained infinitesimally 
close with equilibrium state at each time, such process will be termed as quasi static processor quasi equilibrium process. 
In simple words, we can say that if system is going under a thermodynamic process through 
succession of thermodynamic states and each state is equilibrium state then the process will 
be termed as quasi static process. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df77951e-b19e-4a5e-9dd4-651c59b14d12)

We will see one example for understanding the quasi static process, but let us consider one 
simple example for better understanding of quasi static process. If a person is coming down 
from roof to ground floor with the help of ladder steps then it could be considered as quasi 
static process. But if he jumps from roof to ground floor then it will not be a quasi static 
process. 

Weight placed over the piston is just balancing the force which is exerted in upward 
direction by gas. If we remove the weight from the piston, system will have unbalanced 
force and piston will move in upward direction due to force acting over the piston in upward 
direction by the gas. 

## Irreversible Process: 
The irreversible process is also called the natural process because all the processes occurring 
in nature are irreversible processes. The natural process occurs due to the finite gradient 
between the two states of the system. For instance, heat flow between two bodies occurs 
due to the temperature gradient between the two bodies; this is in fact the natural flow of 
heat. Similarly, water flows from high level to low level, current moves from high potential to low potential, etc.

 In the irreversible process the initial state of the system and surroundings cannot be 
restored from the final state.

 During the irreversible process the various states of the system on the path of 
change from initial state to final state are not in equilibrium with each other. 

 During the irreversible process the entropy of the system increases decisively and it 
cannot be reduced back to its initial value. 

 The phenomenon of a system undergoing irreversible process is called as 
irreversibility. 

## Causes of Irreversibility: 
1. Friction:
 Friction is invariably present in real systems. It causes irreversibility in the process 
as work done does not show an equivalent rise in the kinetic or potential energy of the 
system. The fraction of energy wasted due to frictional effects leads to deviation from 
reversible states. 

2. Free expansion:
 Free expansion refers to the expansion of unresisted type such as expansion 
in a vacuum. During this unresisted expansion the work interaction is zero, and without the 
expense of any work, it is not possible to restore initial states. Thus, free expansion is 
irreversible.

3. Heat transfer through a finite temperature difference:
 Heat transfer occurs only when there 
exists temperature difference between bodies undergoing heat transfer. During heat 
transfer, if heat addition is carried out in a finite number of steps then after every step the 
new state shall be a non-equilibrium state.

4. Non equilibrium during the process:
 Irreversibilities are introduced due to lack of 
thermodynamic equilibrium during the process. Non-equilibrium may be due to mechanical 
inequilibrium, chemical inequilibrium, thermal inequilibrium, electrical inequilibrium, etc. 
and irreversibility is called mechanical irreversibility, chemical irreversibility, thermal 
irreversibility, electrical irreversibility respectively. Factors discussed above are also causing 
non-equilibrium during the process and therefore make process irreversible.

## Heat: 
It is the energy in transition between the system and the surroundings by virtue of the 
difference in temperature Heat is energy transferred from one system to another solely by 
reason of a temperature difference between the systems. Heat exists only as it crosses the boundary of a system and the direction of heat transfer is from higher temperature to lower 
temperature. For thermodynamics sign convention, heat transferred to a system is positive; 
Heat transferred from a system is negative. 

## Work: 
Thermodynamic definition of work: Positive work is done by a system when the sole effect 
external to the system could be reduced to the rise of a weight. 
Work done by the system is positive and work done on the system is negative. 
Types of work interaction: 

 Expansion and compression work (displacement work) 

 Work of a reversible chemical cell 

 Work in stretching of a liquid surface 

 Work done on elastic solids 

 Work of polarization and magnetization

## Point and Path functions: 

 Point function does not depend on the history (or path) of the system. It only 
depends on the state of the system. 

 Examples of point functions are: temperature, pressure, density, mass, volume, 
enthalpy, entropy, internal energy etc. 

 Path function depends on history of the system (or path by which system arrived at a 
given state). 

 Examples for path functions are work and heat. 

 Path functions are not properties of the system, while point functions are properties 
of the system. 

 Change in point function can be obtained by from the initial and final values of the 
function, whereas path has to defined in order to evaluate path functions.

## Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics: 
The Thermodynamics Zeroth Law states that if two systems are at the same time in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in equilibrium with each other. 
If an object with a higher temperature comes in contact with an object of lower 
temperature, it will transfer heat to the lower temperature object. The objects will approach 
the same temperature and in the absence of loss to other objects, they will maintain a single 
constant temperature. Therefore, thermal equilibrium is attained.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b493349-9f16-45fc-9fa3-90d7305609ce)

If objects ‘A’ and ‘C’ are in thermal equilibrium with ‘B’, then object ‘A’ is in thermal 
equilibrium with object ‘C’. Practically this means all three objects are at the same 
temperature and it forms the basis for comparison of temperatures. 
If a=b; b=c then a=c 

## Principles of Thermometry:
Thermometry is the science and practice of temperature measurement. Any measurable 
change in a thermometric probe (e.g. the dilatation of a liquid in a capillary tube, variation of 
electrical resistance of a conductor, of refractive index of a transparent material, and so on) 
can be used to mark temperature levels, that should later be calibrated against an 
internationally agreed unit if the measure is to be related to other thermodynamic variables.Thermometry is sometimes split in metrological studies in two subfields: contact 
thermometry and noncontact thermometry. As there can never be complete thermal 
uniformity at large, thermometry is always associated to a heat transfer problem with some 
space-time coordinates of measurement, given rise to time-series plots and temperature 
maps.

## Joule’s experiment:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2eae173d-4ddc-40f5-8f69-1ee5380d9738)

James P. Joule carried out his famous experiment; he placed known amounts of water, oil, 
and mercury in an insulated container and agitated the fluid with a rotating stirrer. The 
amounts of work done on the fluid by the stirrer were accurately measured, and the 
temperature changes of the fluid were carefully noted. He found for each fluid that a fixed 
amount of work was required per unit mass for every degree of temperature rise caused by 
the stirring, and that the original temperature of the fluid could be restored by the transfer 
of heat through simple contact with a cooler object. In this experiment you can conclude 
there is a relationship between heat and work or in other word heat is a form of energy. 

## Internal Energy 
Through, Joule experiment what happen to energy between time it is added to water as 
work, and time it is extracted to heat? Logic suggests that this energy contained in the water 
in another form which called internal energy.

Internal energy refers to energy of molecules of substance which are ceaseless motion and 
possess kinetics energy. The addition of heat to a substance increases this molecular 
activity, and thus causes an increase in its internal energy. Work done on the substance can 
have the same effect, as was shown by Joule. Internal energy cannot be directly measured; 
there are no internal-energy meters. As a result, absolute values are unknown. However, 
this is not a disadvantage in thermodynamic analysis, because only changes in internal 
energy are required. 

## First Law of Thermodynamics: 
During a thermodynamic cycle, a cyclic process the systems undergoes, the cyclic integral of 
heat added is equal to integral of work done. The first law equation can also be written in 
the form, 

§(dQ – dW) = 0 

Equation dU = dQ – dW is a corollary to the first law of thermodynamics. It shows that there 
exists a property internal energy (U) of the system, such that a change in its value is equal to the difference in heat entering and work leaving the system. 

The First law of thermodynamics states that energy is neither created nor destroyed. Thus 
the total energy of the universe is a constant. However, energy can certainly be transferred 
from one form to another form. 

The 1st law of thermodynamics can be mathematically stated as follows: 
§dQ = §dW

Corollary 1: 
There exists property of closed system; the change in value of this property during the 
process is given by the difference between heat supplied and work done. 
dU = dQ - dW 
Here E is property of system and is called as total energy that includes internal energy, 
kinetic energy, potential energy, electrical energy, magnetic energy, chemical energy, etc. 

Corollary 2: 
For the isolated system, heat and work both interactions are absent (d Q = 0, d W = 0) and   
E = constant. Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed; but, it can be converted from 
one form to other. 

Corollary 3: 
A perpetual motion machine of first kind is almost impossible.

## Perpetual Motion Machine of First Kind (PPM1): 

A hypothetical machine which can produce useful work without any source or which can produce 
more energy than consumed. It violates the first law of Thermodynamics. Perpetual Motion 
Machine 1 (PMM1) is a machine that violates first law of thermodynamics. First law of 
thermodynamics states that energy can be neither created or nor destroyed. A perpetual motion 
machine 1 violates the law by creating energy. All processes in universe comply with first and 
second law of thermodynamics. Therefore PPM1 does not and can never exist. 
e.g.: An electric heater that consumes 1KW of electricity cannot produce more than 1KW heat.

## First law applied to a flow process
## Steady flow energy equation: 

Virtually all the practical systems involve flow of mass across the boundary separating the 
system and the surroundings. Whether it be a steam turbine or a gas turbine or a 
compressor or an automobile engine there exists flow of gases/gas mixtures into and out of 
the system. So we must know how the first Law of thermodynamics can be applied to an 
open system. 

The fluid entering the system will have its own internal, kinetic and potential energies. 
Let u1 be the specific internal energy of the fluid entering C1 be the velocity of the fluid 
while entering Z1 be the potential energy of the fluid while entering Similarly let u2, C2 and Z2 be respective entities while leaving.
