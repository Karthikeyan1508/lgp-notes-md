# UNIT I - Fundamentals of Thermodynamics
## Thermodynamics: 
Thermodynamics is an axiomatic science which deals with the relations among heat, work and 
properties of system which are in equilibrium. It describes state and changes in state of 
physical systems. 
## System: 
A thermodynamic system is defined as a quantity of matter or a region in space which is 
selected for the study. 
## Surroundings: 
The mass or region outside the system is called surroundings. 
## Boundary: 
The real or imaginary surfaces which separates the system and surroundings is called 
boundary. The real or imaginary surfaces which separates the system and surroundings is 
called boundary.

## Types of thermodynamic system 
On the basis of mass and energy transfer the thermodynamic system is divided into three 
types. 
1. Closed system 
2. Open system 
3. Isolated system

## Closed system: A system in which the transfer of energy but not mass can takes place across 
the boundary is called closed system. The mass inside the closed system remains constant. 
For example: Boiling of water in a closed vessel. Since the water is boiled in closed vessel so 
the mass of water cannot escapes out of the boundary of the system but heat energy 
continuously entering and leaving the boundary of the vessel. It is an example of closed 
system. 
## Open system: A system in which the transfer of both mass and energy takes place is called 
an open system. This system is also known as control volume. 
For example: Boiling of water in an open vessel is an example of open system because the 
water and heat energy both enters and leaves the boundary of the vessel. 
## Isolated system: A system in which the transfer of mass and energy cannot takes place is 
called an isolated system. 
For example: Tea present in a thermos flask. In this the heat and the mass of the tea cannot 
cross the boundary of the thermos flask. Hence the thermos flak is an isolated system. 
## Control Volume: 
 It’s a system of fixed volume. 
 This type of system is usually referred to as "open system” or a "control volume" 
 Mass transfer can take place across a control volume. 
 Energy transfer may also occur into or out of the system. 
 Control Surface- It’s the boundary of a control volume across which the transfer of 
both mass and energy takes place. 
 The mass of a control volume (open system) may or may not be fixed. 
 When the net influx of mass across the control surface equals zero then the mass of 
the system is fixed and vice-versa. 
 The identity of mass in a control volume always changes unlike the case for a control 
mass system (closed system). 
 Most of the engineering devices, in general, represent an open system or control  
volume.

## Example: 
Heat exchanger - Fluid enters and leaves the system continuously with the transfer of heat 
across the system boundary. 
Pump - A continuous flow of fluid takes place through the system with a transfer of mechanical 
energy from the surroundings to the system.  
Microscopic View or Study: 
 The approach considers that the system is made up of a very large number of 
discrete particles known as molecules. These molecules have different velocities are 
energies. The values of these energies are constantly changing with time. This 
approach to thermodynamics, which is concerned directly with the structure of the 
matter, is known as statistical thermodynamics. 
 The behavior of the system is found by using statistical methods, as the number of 
molecules is very large. So advanced statistical and mathematical methods are 
needed to explain the changes in the system. 
 The properties like velocity, momentum, impulse, kinetic energy and instruments 
cannot easily measure force of impact etc. that describe the molecule. 
 Large numbers of variables are needed to describe a system. So the approach is 
complicated.
