## Air Standard Cycle

The theoretical cycle of any heat engine using air as a working substance is known as **air standard cycle**.  
The processes used for the operation are reversible.  
The theoretical cycle efficiency of any engine using air as working fluid is known as **air standard efficiency**.

### Two Types:
1. Otto Cycle
2. Diesel Cycle

## Otto Cycle (Constant Volume Cycle)

Otto cycle is the basic cycle used for spark ignition (SI) engines.

**Assumptions:**
- Working fluid is the air which obeys gaseous law.
- Specific heats are constant.
- Compression and expansion processes are adiabatic.
- All processes are reversible.

It consists of four processes:
1. **Process 1-2:** Isentropic compression  
2. **Process 2-3:** Constant volume heat supply  
3. **Process 3-4:** Isentropic expansion  
4. **Process 4-1:** Constant volume heat rejection  

Considering *m* kg of air:  
- \( Q_1 \), heat supplied at constant volume = \( mc_V(T_3 - T_2) \)  
- \( Q_2 \), heat rejected at constant volume = \( mc_V(T_4 - T_1) \)  
- **Work done** = \( Q_1 - Q_2 \) = Heat supplied – Heat rejected

## Diesel Cycle (Constant Pressure Cycle)

A diesel cycle is the basic cycle using diesel as the fuel.  
The assumptions are the same as in the Otto cycle.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed9a3522-871d-42f2-9d37-e0b2d0a5002d)


A diesel engine consists of four processes:
1. **Process 1-2:** Isentropic compression  
2. **Process 2-3:** Constant pressure heat supply  
3. **Process 3-4:** Isentropic expansion  
4. **Process 4-1:** Constant volume heat rejection  

Considering *m* kg of air:  
- \( Q_1 \), heat supplied at constant pressure = \( mc_p(T_3 - T_2) \)  
- \( Q_2 \), heat rejected at constant volume = \( mc_V(T_4 - T_1) \)  
- **Work done** = \( Q_1 - Q_2 \) = Heat supplied – Heat rejected

## Dual Cycle

The dual cycle is a combination of the Diesel Cycle and Otto cycle, incorporating elements of both processes.  
Some advanced internal combustion engines employ it to achieve improved efficiency and performance, as seen in ship engines.  

The dual cycle consists of five processes:
- Intake
- Compression
- Combustion
- Expansion
- Exhaust

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb1a35c2-7529-4691-9e85-7f6a1023cd29)

Process 1 – 2 – Adiabatic compression
In this process, the piston moves from BDC to TDC, the air or air-fuel mixture undergoes adiabatic compression. The volume decreases from V1 to V2, pressure rises from P1 to P2, temperature rises from T1 to T2 and the entropy remains constant (isentropic process) S1 = S2.

Process 2 – 3 – Addition of heat at constant volume
The piston remains at the TDC for a moment, it is the time required for chemical reaction. Heat is added at constant volume V2 = V3. Pressure increases from P2 to P3. Temperature increases from T2 to T3, entropy increases from S2 to S3.

Process 3 – 4 – Addition of heat at constant pressure
The piston remains at the TDC position, heat is added at constant pressure P3 = P4, the volume increases from V3 to V4. The temperature increases from T3 to T4 and the entropy also increases from S3 to S4.

Process 4 – 5 – Adiabatic expansion
The piston moves from TDC to BDC position. Due to the combustion the mixture undergoes adiabatic expansion, the volume increases from V4 to V5, pressure decreases from P4 to P5, temperature decreases from T4 to T5 and the entropy remains same (isentropic process) S4 = S5.

Process 5 – 1 – Heat rejection at constant volume
The piston remains at the BDC position for a moment. Heat is rejected at constant volume. V5 = V1. The pressure decreases from P5 to P1 and temperature decreases from T5 to T1. Entropy also decreases from S5 to S1.

## Working Principle of Four Stroke Spark-Ignition Engine

In a four-stroke engine, the cycle of operations is completed in four strokes of the piston or two revolutions of the crankshaft.
During the four strokes, there are five events to be completed, viz., suction, compression, combustion, expansion and exhaust. Each stroke consists of 180° of crankshaft rotation and hence a four-stroke cycle is completed through 720° of crank rotation.
The cycle of operation for an ideal four-stroke SI engine consists of the following four strokes: (i) suction or intake stroke; (ii) compression stroke; (iii) expansion or power stroke and (iv) exhaust stroke.
The details of various processes of a four-stroke spark-ignition engine with overhead valves are shown in Fig. 1.4 (a-d). When the engine completes all the five events under ideal cycle mode, the pressure-volume (p-V) diagram.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08cc7021-2b69-4a74-b1cf-41faa94826a4)

Four strokes:  
1. **Suction Stroke**  
2. **Compression Stroke**  
3. **Expansion or Power Stroke**  
4. **Exhaust Stroke**

Suction or Intake Stroke: Suction stroke 0→1 starts when the piston is at the top dead centre and about to move downwards. The inlet valve is assumed to open instantaneously and at this time the exhaust valve is in the closed position.
Due to the suction created by the motion of the piston towards the bottom dead centre, the charge consisting of fuel-air mixture is drawn into the cylinder. When the piston reaches the bottom dead centre the suction stroke ends and the inlet valve closes instantaneously. 

Compression Stroke: The charge taken into the cylinder during the suction stroke is compressed by the return stroke of the piston 1→2, (Fig.1.4). During this stroke both inlet and exhaust valves are in closed position,
The mixture which fills the entire cylinder volume is now compressed into the clearance volume. At the end of the compression stroke the mixture is ignited with the help of a spark plug located on the cylinder head.

Expansion or Power Stroke: The high pressure of the burnt gases forces the piston towards the BDC, (stroke 3→4)
Both the valves are in closed position, Of the four-strokes only during this stroke power is produced. Both pressure and temperature decrease during expansion.

Exhaust Stroke: At the end of the expansion stroke the exhaust valve opens instantaneously and the inlet valve remains closed, Fig. 1.4. The pressure falls to atmospheric level as a part of the burnt gases escape. 
The piston starts moving from the bottom dead centre to top dead centre (stroke 5→0), and sweeps the burnt gases out from the cylinder almost at atmospheric pressure. The exhaust valve closes when the piston reaches TDC.
Thus for one complete cycle there is only one power stroke while the crankshaft makes two revolutions. For getting higher output from the engine the heat addition (process 2→3) should be as high as possible and the heat rejection (process 3→4) should be as small as possible. Hence, one should be careful in drawing the ideal p - V diagram which should represent the processes correctly.

Each stroke consists of 180° crankshaft rotation (total: 720°)

## Working Principle of Four Stroke Compression-Ignition Engine

Same as SI engine with higher compression ratio (16 to 20).  
Air alone is inducted, fuel injected at end of compression.

The four-stroke Cl engine is similar to the four-stroke SI engine but it operates at a much higher compression ratio. The compression ratio of an SI engine is between 6 and 10 while for a Cl engine it is from 16 to 20.

In the Cl engine during suction stroke, air, instead of a fuel-air mixture, is inducted. Due to higher compression ratios employed, the temperature at the end of the compression stroke is sufficiently high to self-ignite the fuel which is injected into the combustion chamber.

In Cl engines, a high pressure fuel pump and an injector are provided to inject the fuel into the combustion chamber. The carburetor and ignition system necessary in the SI engine are not required in the Cl engine. 

### Description:
- **Suction Stroke:** Air intake
- **Compression Stroke:** Air compressed
- **Expansion Stroke:** Fuel injection causes ignition and expansion
- **Exhaust Stroke:** Combustion gases expelled

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c17736f7-8926-46e2-9fe7-834abf00e3bb)

Suction Stroke: In the suction stroke piston moves from TDC to BDC. Air alone is inducted during the suction stroke. During this stroke the inlet valve is open and the exhaust valve is closed.

Compression Stroke: In this stroke piston moves from BDC to TDC. Air inducted during the suction stroke is compressed into the clearance volume. Both valves remain closed during this stroke.

Expansion Stroke: Fuel injection starts nearly at the end of the compression stroke. The rate of injection is such that combustion maintains the pressure constant in spite of the piston movement on its expansion stroke increasing the volume. Heat is assumed to have been added at constant pressure.

Exhaust Stroke: The piston travelling from BDC to TDC pushes out the products of combustion. The exhaust valve is open and the intake valve is closed during this stroke.
Due to higher pressures in the cycle of operations the Cl engine has to be sturdier than a SI engine for the same output. This results in a Cl engine being heavier than the SI engine. However, it has a higher thermal efficiency on account of the high compression ratio (of about 18 as against about 8 in SI engines) used.

## Two-Stroke Engine
In two-stroke engines the cycle is completed in one revolution of the crankshaft. The main difference between two-stroke and four-stroke engines is in the method of filling the fresh charge and removing the burnt gases from the cylinder.

In the four-stroke engine these operations are performed by the engine piston during the suction and exhaust strokes respectively.
In a two- stroke engine, the filling process is accomplished by the charge compressed in the crankcase or by a blower. The induction of the compressed charge moves out the product of combustion through exhaust ports. Therefore, no separate piston strokes are required for these two operations.

Two strokes are sufficient to complete the cycle, one for compressing the fresh charge and the other for expansion or power stroke. It is to be noted that the effective stroke is reduced.

Figure 1.8 shows one of the simplest two-stroke engines, viz., the crankcase scavenged engine.
The air-fuel charge is inducted into the crankcase through the spring loaded inlet valve when the pressure in the crankcase is reduced due to upward motion of the piston during compression stroke. After the compression and ignition, expansion takes place in the usual way.

During the expansion stroke the charge in the crankcase is compressed. Near the end of the expansion stroke, the piston uncovers the exhaust ports and the cylinder pressure drops to atmospheric pressure as the combustion products leave the cylinder.

The piston top usually has a projection to deflect the fresh charge towards the top of the cylinder preventing the flow through the exhaust ports. This serves the double purpose of scavenging the combustion products from the upper part of the cylinder and preventing the fresh charge from flowing out directly through the exhaust ports.

Cycle completed in one revolution.  
Filling and scavenging done by compressed charge.

### Two strokes:
1. **Expansion Stroke:** Piston moves down, ignites fuel
2. **Compression Stroke:** Piston moves up, compresses charge

First stroke At the beginning of the first stroke the piston is at the TDC as shown in fig. A. Piston moves from TDC to BDC.

The electric spark ignites the compressed charge in petrol engine & Diesel spray in diesel engine when compression stroke is about complete . The combustion of the charge will release the hot gases which increase the temperature and pressure in the cylinder. The high pressure combustion engine forces the piston downward.

**Petrol Engine:**

Suction Stroke and Compression Stroke:
Suction means charge drawn into engine cylinder or in case of two stroke engine in crankcase and compression means compressed the previous drawn charge into engine cylinder. In two strokes engines, both these process take place simultaneously. When the piston moves from BDC to TDC, the inlet port opens and partially vacuum created into crankcase which accelerates charge drawn into crankcase. Simultaneously the piston compressed the charge available in engine cylinder or combustion chamber. The exhaust port remain closed during this stroke.

Power and Exhaust Stroke:
In this stroke, piston moves from TDC to BDC. Inlet port remains open for first half of this stroke and closed in other half. Simultaneously, exhaust port remains closed during first half of this stroke and open into second half. Transfer port opens into second half of this stroke.

Diesel Engine:

Suction and Compression Stroke:
In a 2-stroke engine, the suction and compression strokes take place simultaneously.
During this stroke, the piston moves upward from the bottom dead center (BDC) to the top dead center (TDC).
During this upward movement of the piston, a vacuum starts producing inside the compression cylinder (combustion chamber) of the engine. Due to the creation of this vacuum, the air-fuel mixture enters the cylinder via an inlet port.
After the suction process, the piston continues its upward movement and compresses the air-fuel mixture.
At the end of the compression stroke, the compressed mixture is ignited due to the spark provided by a spark plug. As the mixture ignites, the power stroke piston starts.

2) Power and Exhaust Stroke:
Like suction and compression strokes, the power and exhaust process also complete in just one stroke of the piston.
Due to the combustion process, the temperature, internal heat, and pressure of the air-fuel mixture become very high. The high-pressure gases produced during the combustion process exert a very high force on the piston and force it to move downward (from TDC to BCD).
The downward motion of the piston rotates the crankshaft, which further rotates the flywheel of the vehicle.
As the power is completed, the piston further moves downward and opens the exhaust valve.
As the exhaust valve opens, the piston pushes the exhaust gases out of the combustion chamber.
As the piston reaches at BDC, the piston completely expels the exhaust gases and fills the combustion chamber with the fresh air-fuel mixture, and the whole working cycle repeats. At BDC, one power stroke of the engine is completed, and now the piston is ready for the next power cycle.

**VAPOUR POWER CYCLES:**

In any thermodynamic process, the use of working fluid gas or vapour is an essential
working medium to convert heat into work. A cycle, which continuously converts
heat into work is called the power cycle. In a power cycle, the working fluid performs
the various processes, which are suction, compression, expanding, condensing, etc.
All these processes are performed repeatedly to generate the work or converting heat
in to work. If the steam is alternatively vaporised and condensed, then the working
cycle is called vapour power cycle.

CARNOT VAPOUR CYCLE:

The Carnot vapour cycle is used as an ideal power cycle for steam power plants.Consider an ideal Carnot cycle as shown is the Figure 10.1. Here the working fluidis water, in the cyclic process 1-2, water is heated reversibly and isothermally in a boiler, in the process 2-3 it is expanded isentropically in a turbine, in the process 3-4, then expanded water is condensed reversibly and isothermally in a condenser and finally in the process 4-1, the fluid is compressed isentropically by a compressor to the initial state.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eba2ece2-174e-4369-bd42-5b08d077a82a)

The four Carnot cycle processes are :
• Isothermal heat addition from process 1-2,
• Isentropic expansion of steam in an expander from process 2-3,
• Isothermal heat rejection in the condenser from process 3-4, and
• Isentropic compression of a mixture of vapour and liquid from process
4-1.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/014b6be1-0d6a-4521-8374-4a682f97a65a)

Limitations of Carnot Cycle:

Carnot vapour power cycle is an ideal cycle, efficiency of which is
independent of the working substance.

difficult to operate in practice because of the following reasons :
(a) It is difficult to compress a wet vapour isentroprically to the
saturated state as required by the process (4-1).
(b) It is difficult to control the quality of the condensate coming out of
the condenser so that the state ‘4’ is exactly obtained.
(c) The efficiency of the Carnot cycle is correctly attached by the
temperature T1 at which heat is transferred to the working fluid.
Since the temperature of steam is only 374o
C, therefore, if the cycle is to be operated in the wet region, the maximum possible
temperature is severely limited.
(d) Isentropic compression of a vapour requires more work due to its
high specific volume thereby reducing the work ratio.
(e) Isothermal heat addition after the saturated vapour line is very
difficult to achieve as it involves heat addition at the same time
expansion of steam.

RANKINE CYCLE:

Rankine cycle is simplest and an ideal cycle for vapour power cycles. Rankine cycle
has four components and four thermodynamic processes. So each one of process
takes place in each component.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43acddb1-09e9-44de-88e6-892cd1bb0bb5)

The four process takes places in rankine cycle are :
• The process 1-2 is isentropic expansion in the turbine,
• The process 2-3 is isobaric reversible heat rejection in the condenser,
• The process 3-4 is a reversible adiabatic compression takes place in the pump.
• The process 4-1 is a isobaric heat addition process in the boiler.

To analyse and determine the efficiency of rankine cycle by taking working fluid as
water (1 kg) flowing through all the components of rankine cycle system. By
observing the rankine cycle in P-V, T-S and H-S diagrams as shown in Figure 10.2(b)
for calculating the efficiency of the rankine cycle.

![rankine efficiency (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56918366-6890-453b-9aa5-7ef825864917)

REHEAT RANKINE CYCLE:

Earlier we have explained that increasing the steam pressure at inlet to turbine and decreasing the steam pressure at exhaust will increase the thermal efficiency of Vapour Power cycle. In this system the moisture problem will be encountered at the final stage of the turbine. To over come this problem the ideal reheat and Regenerative cycle procedures will be used. In practice reheat and regeneration both are used for improve the overall efficiency of the vapour power cycles.

In this cycle extra low pressure turbine is added. In reheat Rankine cycle; the steam which is collected from the HP turbine is reheated with the help of fine gases in the boiler furnace. Then the reheated steam is sent to the LP turbine and the regular power cycle. The two turbines are used here because reheating is done at higher pressures only. The reheating can be done two or more stages, which will be determined by economical consideration.

Advantages of Reheat Cycles:

Reheated steam eliminated the erosion and corrosion to the blades of the
turbine,
• Turbine output will be increased,
• ηth will be increased,
• Final dryness fraction is improved,
• Nozzle and blade efficiencies are increased, and
• Specific steam consumption is decreased.
