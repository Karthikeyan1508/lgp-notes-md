# Smart Materials

## Introduction to smart materials: 

Smart materials are materials that are manipulated to respond in a controllable and reversible way, modifying some of their properties as a result of external stimuli such as certain mechanical stress or a certain temperature, among others. 

●​ Smart systems consist of sensors and actuators that are either embedded in or attached to the system containing a central control and command unit to form an integral part of it. 

●​ Smart or intelligent materials are materials that have the intrinsic and extrinsic capabilities, first, to respond to stimuli and environmental changes and, second,to activate their functions according to these changes. 

●​ Stimulus —stress, strain, light, electric field, temperature and pressure, etc. 

●​ Response —motion or change in optical properties, modulus, surface tension, piezoelectricity etc. 

## Classification of smart materials

### Actively Smart: 

They possess the capacity to modify their geometric or material properties under the application of electric, thermal or magnetic fields, thereby acquiring an inherent capacity to transduce energy. 

●​ Piezoelectric 

●​ Magneto strictive 

●​ Shape memory alloys 

●​ Electro-Rheological fluid, etc.

They can be used as force transducers and actuators.

### Passively Smart:

Those smart materials that are not active are called passively smart materials. Although smart,they lack the inherent capability to transduce energy. 

### ●​ Optic fibers 

These materials can act as sensors but not as actuators or transducers.

## Types of smart materials:

## 1. Piezoelectric materials:​

They can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. For example,they change their shape in response to an electrical impulse or produce an electrical charge in response to an applied mechanical stress. 

●​ Materials that produce a voltage when stress is applied. (An applied mechanical stress will generate a voltage).​

Example: Quartz, BaTiO3, GaPO4 

●​ The piezoelectric effect describes the relation between a mechanical stress and an electrical voltage in solids. 

●​ In physics, the piezoelectric effect can be described as the link between electrostatics and mechanics. 

●​ An LED is wired to a piezoelectric transducer. The LED briefly lights when the device is flicked & shows that electricity has been generated by stress and strain.

### Reverse Piezoelectric effect: 

●​ An applied voltage will change the shape of the solid by a small amount (up to a 4%change in volume). 

●​ Quartz watches, Piezoelectric US oscillator.

### Application of Piezoelectric effect: 

●​ In lighters or portable sparkers with a piezo fuze a sudden and strong pressure is used to produce a voltage. The spark then ignites the gas. 

●​ A piezo motor is based on the change in mechanical shape of a piezoelectric material when a tension is applied. The material produces ultrasonic or acoustic vibrations and produces a linear or rotary motion. Prepared by: DRP 

●​ Piezo elements are used in music for acoustic instruments. They are inserted in stringed instruments such as guitar, violin or Mandolin. The dynamic deformation/vibration of the cords is converted into a small alternating voltage.

## 2. Magnetostrictive materials: 

●​ Magnetostriction is a property of ferromagnetic materials that causes them to change their shape or dimensions during the process of magnetization. 

●​ The effect was first identified in 1842 by James Joule when observing a sample of iron.Ex: Fe, Co, Terfenol –D (US transducers, sonar, sound bug)

## 3. Magnetorheological fluids (MRFs):

●​ A MR fluid is a smart fluid which usually consists of 20-40 percent iron particles,suspended in mineral oil, synthetic oil, water or glycol. 

●​ MRF also contains a substance which prevents the iron particles from setting.

●​ When subjected to a magnetic field, the magnetic particles inside increase the fluid's viscosity, rendering it viscoelastic solid. 


![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/216f5fe7a379f0c3.jpg)

MRF solidifying and blocking a pipe in response to an external magnetic field. 

$"OFF"$ position – the MR fluid is not magnetized & the particles inside, distributed randomly, allow the fluid to move freely, acting like a damper fluid. 

●​ “ON” position – the particles become energized and align into fibrous structures and restrict the movement of the fluid.

### Shape Memory Alloys: 

●​ An alloy that remembers” its original, cold-forged shape. By heating it returns back to the re-deformed shape. 

●​ SMAs are materials which can revert back to original shape & size on cooling by undergoing phase transformations. 

●​ Shape memory alloys (SMA's) are metals, which exhibit pseudo-elasticity and the shape memory effect. 

●​ Examples: NiTiNOL (thermal), NiMnGa, Fe-Pd, Terfenol-D (Magnetic) CuZnSi, CuZnAl, CuZnGa, CuZnSn(actuator) 

●​ The shape change involves a solid-state phase change involving a molecular rearrangement between Martensite and Austenite. 

●​ A temperature change of only about 10o C is necessary to initiate this phase change.

#### The Shape alloys are currently being used in: 

●​ The space shuttles

●​ Thermostats 

●​ Vascular Stents 

●​ Hydraulic Fittings (for Airplanes)

●​ Coffee pots 

### Shape memory effect: 

The Shape memory effect is controlled by a structural rearrangement on the atomic scale. At room temperature the atoms from the structure shown below: 


![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/c2ef63ddb86fe489.jpg)

●​ The special property that allows shape memory alloys to revert to their original shape after heating is that their crystal transformation is fully reversible. 

●​ This phenomenon results from a crystalline phase change known as "thermo-elastic martensitic transformation". 

●​ At temperatures below the transformation temperature. shape memory alloys are o martensitic,In this condition. Their micro-structure is characterized by "self-accommodating twins “. The martensite* is soft and can be deformed quite easily by DE-twinning. Heating above the transformation temperature recovers the original shape and converts the material to its high strength austenitic condition.

## Super-elasticity and the Shape Memory Effect 

### SENSORS: 

●​ A device which provides a usable output in response to a specified measure.

●​ Sensor is a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment. Input could be light, heat, motion, moisture, force, pressure, displacement, etc. 

●​ It produces a proportional output signal (electrical, mechanical, magnetic, etc.). 

### PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES: 

## Ampere's Law:

A current carrying conductor in a magnetic field experiences a force (e.g. Galvanometer).

## Curie-Weiss Law: 

There is a transition temperature at which ferromagnetic materials exhibit paramagnetic behaviour. 

## Faraday’s Law of Induction: 

A coil resists a change in magnetic field by generating an opposing voltage/current (e.g.transformer). 

## Photoconductive Effect: 

When light strikes certain semiconductor materials, the resistance of the material decreases (e.g. photo resistor). 

## NEED FOR SENSORS: 

●​ Sensors are omnipresent. They are embedded in our bodies, automobiles, airplanes,cellular telephones, radios, chemical plants, industrial plants and countless other applications. 

●​ Sensors in industrial applications being used for process control, monitoring, and safety, and in medicine being used for diagnostics, Their monitoring, critical care, and public health. 

●​ Sensors can improve the world through diagnostics in medical applications; improved performance of energy sources like fuel cells and batteries and solar power; improved health and safety and security for people; sensors for exploring space and improved environmental monitoring.

## Advantages: 

●​ They are inexpensive.

●​ They are simple to operate 17 They are very useful for measurement of large amplitudes of displacement. 

●​ Their electrical efficiency is very high.It should be understood that while the frequency response of wire wound potentiometers is limited, the other types of potentiometers are free from this problem. 

●​ In wire wound potentiometers the resolution is limited while in Cermet and metal film potentiometers, the resolution is infinite. 

## Disadvantages: 

●​ Using a linear potentiometer requires a large force to move their sliding contacts (wipers). 

●​ The other problems with sliding contacts are that they can be contaminated, can wear out, become misaligned and generate noise. So life is limited 

## Actuators:

●​ An actuator is a device that converts any source of energy into physical motion. It receives an energy source and then, it converts that into a motion that moves the object on which the actuator is mounted. 

●​ In industrial automation applications, take a simple example of a valve. The actuator is a mechanical or electro-mechanical device, which when connected with the valve; moves the valve through the mechanical force applied by the actuator.

## Applications of actuators: 

●​ Engine and transmission control systems rely on actuators to manage essential functions such as throttle control, fuel injection, and gear shifting. These actuators ensure optimal engine performance, fuel efficiency, and smooth gear transitions, contributing to a comfortable and efficient driving experience. 

●​ Suspension systems use actuators to adjust the vehicle's ride height, damping, and stiffness, adapting to different road conditions and driving styles. Active suspension systems, in particular, employ actuators to continuously adjust the suspension settings in real-time, providing improved handling, comfort, and safety. 

●​ Braking systems incorporate actuators to apply and release the brakes, ensuring effective stopping power and vehicle stability. Advanced braking systems, such as anti-lock braking systems (ABS) and electronic stability control (ESC), use actuators to modulate brake pressure in response to wheel slip and vehicle dynamics, enhancing safety and control during critical driving situations. 

●​ Flight control systems in aircraft rely on actuators to manipulate control surfaces such as ailerons, elevators, and rudders. These actuators respond to pilot inputs and autopilot commands, adjusting the control surfaces to achieve the desired changes in pitch, roll, 

and yaw. The precision and responsiveness of these actuators are critical for maintaining aircraft stability and control during flight. 

●​ Landing gear systems use actuators to extend and retract the landing gear, ensuring safe takeoffs and landings. These actuators must be reliable and robust, as they are subjected to significant loads and harsh operating conditions. Additionally, actuators are used in braking systems and steering mechanisms for the landing gear, providing precise control during ground operations. 

●​ Engine control systems in aircraft and spacecraft employ actuators to manage critical functions such as fuel flow, thrust vectoring, and nozzle adjustments. These actuators ensure optimal engine performance, fuel efficiency, and safe operation under various flight conditions. 

## types of Actuators: 

## 1.​ Pneumatic actuators: 

●​ Pneumatic actuators are the devices used for converting pressure energy of compressed air into mechanical energy to perform useful work. In other words, Actuators are used to perform the task of exerting the required force at the end of the stroke or used to create displacement by the movement of the piston. The pressurised air from the compressor is supplied to the reservoir. The pressurised air from storage is supplied to the pneumatic actuator to do work. 

●​ The air cylinder is a simple and efficient device for providing linear thrust or straight line motions with a rapid speed of response. Friction losses are low, seldom exceeding 5 % with a cylinder in good condition, and cylinders are particularly suitable for single purpose applications and /or where rapid movement is required. They are also suitable for use under conditions which preclude the employment of hydraulic cylinders that are at high ambient temperature of up to 200 to 250. 

### Types of Pneumatic actuators: 

Linear Actuator or Pneumatic cylinders: 

Pneumatic cylinders are devices for converting the air pressure into linear mechanical force and motion. The pneumatic cylinders are basically used for single purpose applications such as clamping, stamping, transferring, branching, allocating, ejecting, metering, tilting, bending,turning and many other applications.

### Based on application for which air cylinders are used:

Air cylinders can be classified according to their intended use, as light duty, medium duty or heavy duty types. In the main this merely govverns the strength of the cylinder, and thus typical choice of material of construction and the form of construction. Comparison is given in Table 1.It should be noted that classification by duty does not necessarily affect the output 59performance of the cylinder, as bore size for bore size; identical cylinder diameter will give the same thrust on the same line pressure, regardless of whether the cylinder is rated for light,medium or heavy duty. This form of rating, however, normally precludes the use of light classification for cylinders of large size (and thus high thrust); and medium classification for cylinders of even large size and very high thrust outputs.

#### 2. Hydraulic Actuators:

**·** The hydraulic actuator uses a hydraulic fluid (for example, oil) to energize the actuator and cause motion. They have a hollow cylindrical tubing or fluid motor, which generates pressuure to cause motion.

●​ A piston is suspended at the center of the actuator. When the fluid enters the bottom of the cylinder, a large pressure is formed by the fluid, which forces the piston to move and slide. 

●​ This piston then moves the device with which the actuator is connected. The piston moves in the direction opposite to the spring connected at the other side (upper part of the cylinder) and the applied pressure moves the device. 

##### Advantages: 

●​ Design is simple

## 3.​ Electrical Actuators: 

●​ The electrical actuator converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. ​Typically, a motor is used as a power for electrical energy into mechanical torque.

●​ Similar to pneumatic actuators, electrical actuators are accurate and precise.They are widely used in all types of industrial machines. 

Types of electrical actuators:

The latest electric actuator is established from the regulator control signal to attain a prearranged linear reciprocating motion. This sequence of electric actuators is employed as the regulating valve actuator, almost with the control valve itself needing a range of action change function, and the opening of the electric actuator valve signal function and physical function. Thus, it is extensively used in various industries like power generation, metallurgical, papermaking, petrochemical, environmental protection and light industries.

## 4.​ Thermal Actuators: 

●​ The thermal actuators are relatively simpler types of actuators. It uses thermal energy as a source of energy for movement. 

●​ When the temperature rises, the temperature-sensitive material begins to expand;exerting pressure on the piston. 

●​ When the temperature drops, the material begins to compress and starts pulling the piston back to its normal position.
