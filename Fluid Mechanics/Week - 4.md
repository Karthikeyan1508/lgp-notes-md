#  Fluid

Fluid is the phase of substance which can’t resist any external shear force in static condition.
Fluid ⇒ Continuous deformation under the action of shear force.

τ ∝dθ/dt

Here dθ/dt is deformation rate (or) shear strain rate during steady state.

# Fluid Properties
## Mass Density / Density:
Density is defined as the mass per unit volume.
Mathematically
Density (ρ) = mass (m)/Volume(V)
On Increasing Temperature ⇒ Density decreases.
On Increasing Pressure ⇒ Density increases.

Units:

(i) kg/m3

(ii) gm/cm3

Dimensional formula: [ρ] = [ML−3]
## Specific volume:

Specific volume is defined as the volume per unit mass.
Mathematically

Specific volume, (V)=(v)/(m), Volume/mass

Units:
(i) m3/kg ,
Dimensional formula: = [M−1 L3]
## Weight Density/Specific Weight (𝐰):
Weight density / Specific weight is defined as the weight per unit volume.

Mathematically,

Specific weight (w) = Weight/Volume

w = ρg

On increasing Temperature ⇒ Specific weight decreases.
On increasing Pressure ⇒ Specific weight increases.

Units:
-  $\frac{N}{m^3}$
-  $\frac{kg}{m^2 \cdot s^2}$
-  $\frac{gm}{cm^2 \cdot s^2}$

Dimensional formula: [w] = [ML−2 T−2]

## Specific Gravity (s):
Specific gravity is defined as the ratio of density of fluid to the density of standard fluid.

Specific gravity (s) = Density of fluid (ρ)/Density of Standard Fluid (ρs)

$S = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{\text{water}}}$

Water is taken as standard fluid.

Water is Specific gravity is UNITLESS.

## Viscosity of Liquid (𝛍):

When the liquid is in motion, the internal resistance offered by one layer of liquid to the adjacent layer of liquid is
known as viscosity.

• In any fluid viscosity is because of

(a) Cohesive force between fluid particles.

(b) Molecular momentum exchange

• For liquid at rest or relative rest, the concept of viscosity is not valid

• For Ideal fluid, cohesion is zero hence viscosity is also zero.
## Newton’s Law of Viscosity:

The shear stress is directly proportional to the velocity gradient. The shear stress between the two adjacent layers of the fluid is directly proportional to the negative value of the velocity gradient between the same two adjacent layers of the fluid.

- $\tau \propto \frac{d\theta}{dt}$

- $\tau = \mu \frac{du}{dy}$

- $\mu = \frac{\tau}{du/dy}$
- 
  Here,
  
μ =Cofficient of viscosity or absolute viscosity or dynamic viscosity

## Compressibility (𝛃𝐜):

Compressibility of a fluid refers to its ability to change its volume and density when subjected to pressure. The
coefficient of compressibility c is defined as the relative change of volume (or density) per unit pressure.

$K = \frac{1}{\beta_c} = \frac{dp}{\left( \frac{dv}{v} \right)}$

Where,
dp = change in pressure
dv = change in volume
v = volume of the fluid
d = change in density

## Bulk modulus (K):

The bulk modulus of elasticity K is defined as the ratio of compressive stress to volumetric strain. Mathematically it
is the reciprocal of compressibility.

$\beta_c = -\frac{dv/v}{dp} = \frac{d\rho/\rho}{dp}$

The bulk modulus of liquid and solid are the property of material. In other words, for a given liquid and solid, bulk
modulus will be constant.
For gases, bulk modulus is not the property of material but depends on the process.

# Types of Fluid:

## Ideal Fluid:

A fluid which has 0 viscosity, incompressible and zero surface tension is known as Ideal Fluid. 
## Real Fluid:

A real fluid is a fluid which has viscosity, finite compressibility and surface tension.

# Fluid Statics
Pressure is the term used for a force distributed over an area

Pressure can be measured in two different ways

Absolute pressure: 

is the pressure measured above an absolute or perfect vacuum. The absolute pressure of the surrounding atmosphere is approximately and a perfect vacuum is 0 psi or 0 kPa.

Gage pressure:

is the pressure indicated by a standard pressure gage. The gage reads zero when exposed directly to the atmosphere, positive when the pressure is higher than atmospheric pressure, and negative pressure indicates a vacuum. In effect, pressure gages ignores the pressure of the atmosphere which surrounds us.

## Principles of Fluid Statics:

A fluid, like water or air exerts a pressure on its surroundings. This pressure applies a distributed load on surfaces surrounding the fluid, like the face of a dam, an irrigation control gate, a teakettle, or the drum of a steam boiler.

When you dive underwater, the pressure you feel in your ears increases with depth. At the surface, the gage pressure is zero no matter which unit system you use. As you descend, the fluid pressure p increases with depth according to the equation

$P = \rho g h$

where:🔗
 - p is the density of a fluid,
 - g is gravitational acceleration, and
 - h is the height of fluid above the point of interest.

Since fluid pressure increases linearly with depth, it behaves as a distributed load which increases linearly from 0 at the surface to pgh at depth h, acting normal to the surface. The pressure can be replaced with an equivalent force acting through the centroid of the triangular loading, with a magnitude equal to the triangular area. The pressure on horizontal surfaces is constant, and it is normal to all surfaces.

## Pascal’s Law and Fluid Statics

According to equation (12.16),

$p = p_0 + \rho g h$

The pressure at any depth $h$ in a fluid may be increased by increasing the surface pressure $p_0$.

Pascal recognized a consequence of this fact that we now call **Pascal’s Law**:

> **A pressure applied to a confined fluid at rest is transmitted equally and undiminished to every part of the fluid and the walls of the container.**

This principle is used in a **hydraulic jack or lift**, as shown in the figure below.

### Hydraulic System Principle

The pressure due to a small force $F_1$ applied to a piston of area $A_1$ is transmitted to the larger piston of area $A_2$.

Since the pistons are

# Kinematics of Fluid Flow:

Kinematics of fluid flow deals with the motion of fluid particles without considering the agency producing the motion. This deals with the geometry of motion of fluid particles. This also deals with the velocity and acceleration of fluid particles in motion. The motion of a fluid can be analysed on the same principles as those applied in the motion of a solid.

## Methods of Describing Fluid Motion:
Stream Line:

A stream line is a continuous line in a fluid which shows the direction of the velocity of the fluid at each point along the line. The tangent to the stream line at any point on it is in the direction of the velocity at that point. Fluid particles lying on a stream line at an instant move along the stream line.

- For example, as a fluid flows round a cylindrical body, the stream line pattern will be as shown in Fig. 6.3. In steady flow the velocity at a point does not change in its magnitude and directions Hence, there is no change in the direction of the velocity vector at a point. In other words, the stream line is fixed in position. Conversely, if the stream line pattern remains constant the flow is steady. In the case of an unsteady flow, the direction of the velocity changes with time at every point. This means the position of a stream line is not constant. The position of a stream line changes from instant to instant.

Path Line:

A path line means the path or a line actually described by a single fluid particle as it moves during a period of time. The path line indicates the direction of the velocity of the same fluid particle at successive instants of time.

Streak Line:

- The streak line is the locus of the positions of fluid particles which have passed through a given point in succession. Suppose A, B, C, D… are fluid particles which passed through a reference point say the origin one after the other in succession. These particles have described their own path lines. Suppose at a time t, these particles A, B, C, D… are at Pa,

Pb, Pc, Pd …. The line Pa, Pb, Pc, Pd …. is the streak line, at time t.

Stream Tube:

- A stream tube is an imaginary tubular space formed by a number of stream lines. It is an assembly or collection of stream lines forming a tabular space. The surface of a stream tube is made up of stream lines. The velocity of a fluid particle on the surface of the stream tube is along the stream line over the surface of the stream tube. This means there can be no flow across the walls of a stream tube.

Potential Lines:

- On a surface consisting of stream lines, we can imagine lines running orthogonally with the stream lines. Such line are called potential lines.

## Types of Flow:

(i) Laminar flow and turbulent flow.

(ii) Steady flow and unsteady flow.

(iii) Uniform flow and non-uniform flow.

(iv) Rotational and irrotational flow.

## (i) Laminar and Turbulent Flow:

Laminar Flow:

- This is a type of flow in which the fluid particles move in layers, gilding smoothly over adjacent layers. There is no transportation of fluid particles from one layer to another. The fluid particles in any layer move along well defined stream lines.

- The paths of the individual particles do not cross each other. This type of flow is also called stream line flow or viscous flow. This is a smooth flow of one layer of fluid over another. This type of flow occurs in viscous fluids where viscosity influences the flow.

Turbulent Flow:
- This is the most common type of flow that occurs in nature. This flow is characterised by random, erratic, unpredictable motion of fluid particles which result in eddy currents. There is a general mixing up of fluid particles, in motion. The velocity changes in direction and magnitude from point to point.
- There is a continuous collision between particles resulting in transference of momentum between them. The eddy currents cause a considerable loss of energy compared to the loss of energy in laminar flow. This greater loss of energy is due to the fact that turbulent shear stresses are very much greater than laminar shear stress given by Newton’s law of viscosity.

## (ii) Steady Flow and Unsteady Flow:

Steady Flow:
- If the flow characteristics like, velocity, density, pressure etc. at a given point in a flowing mass of fluid does not change with the passage of time, the flow is said to be steady. On the contrary, if these flow characteristics at a given point change with respect to time, the flow is said to be unsteady flow.
- Since velocity is a commonly adopted characteristic of flow it is quite sufficient to regard the flow to be steady if the velocity at a given point does not change with respect to time.
- Suppose V is the velocity at a point (x1, y1, z1). At this point if V remains constant at all times the flow is a steady flow. But, if at this point, V changes with time the flow is unsteady flow i.e.,

(iii) Uniform and Non-Uniform Flow:

- If the flow characteristics like velocity, density, pressure etc. at a given instant remain the same at all points, the flow is uniform. If V is chosen as a flow characteristic, then, at a given instant V has the same value at all points and is independent of the space position. If the flow characteristics have different values at different points at a given instant of time, the flow is non-uniform flow.
