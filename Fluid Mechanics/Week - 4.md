#  Fluid

Fluid is the phase of substance which can’t resist any external shear force in static condition.
Fluid ⇒ Continuous deformation under the action of shear force.

τ ∝dθ/dt

Here dθ/dt is deformation rate (or) shear strain rate during steady state.

# Fluid Properties
## Mass Density / Density:
Density is defined as the mass per unit volume.
Mathematically
Density (ρ) = mass (m)/Volume(V)
On Increasing Temperature ⇒ Density decreases.
On Increasing Pressure ⇒ Density increases.

Units:

(i) kg/m3

(ii) gm/cm3

Dimensional formula: [ρ] = [ML−3]
## Specific volume:

Specific volume is defined as the volume per unit mass.
Mathematically

Specific volume, (V)=(v)/(m), Volume/mass

Units:
(i) m3/kg ,
Dimensional formula: = [M−1 L3]
## Weight Density/Specific Weight (𝐰):
Weight density / Specific weight is defined as the weight per unit volume.

Mathematically,

Specific weight (w) = Weight/Volume

w = ρg

On increasing Temperature ⇒ Specific weight decreases.
On increasing Pressure ⇒ Specific weight increases.

Units:
-  $\frac{N}{m^3}$
-  $\frac{kg}{m^2 \cdot s^2}$
-  $\frac{gm}{cm^2 \cdot s^2}$

Dimensional formula: [w] = [ML−2 T−2]

## Specific Gravity (s):
Specific gravity is defined as the ratio of density of fluid to the density of standard fluid.

Specific gravity (s) = Density of fluid (ρ)/Density of Standard Fluid (ρs)

$S = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{\text{water}}}$

Water is taken as standard fluid.

Water is Specific gravity is UNITLESS.

## Viscosity of Liquid (𝛍):

When the liquid is in motion, the internal resistance offered by one layer of liquid to the adjacent layer of liquid is
known as viscosity.

• In any fluid viscosity is because of

(a) Cohesive force between fluid particles.

(b) Molecular momentum exchange

• For liquid at rest or relative rest, the concept of viscosity is not valid

• For Ideal fluid, cohesion is zero hence viscosity is also zero.
## Newton’s Law of Viscosity:

The shear stress is directly proportional to the velocity gradient. The shear stress between the two adjacent layers of the fluid is directly proportional to the negative value of the velocity gradient between the same two adjacent layers of the fluid.

- $\tau \propto \frac{d\theta}{dt}$

- $\tau = \mu \frac{du}{dy}$

- $\mu = \frac{\tau}{du/dy}$
- 
  Here,
  
μ =Cofficient of viscosity or absolute viscosity or dynamic viscosity

## Compressibility (𝛃𝐜):

Compressibility of a fluid refers to its ability to change its volume and density when subjected to pressure. The
coefficient of compressibility c is defined as the relative change of volume (or density) per unit pressure.

$K = \frac{1}{\beta_c} = \frac{dp}{\left( \frac{dv}{v} \right)}$

Where,
dp = change in pressure
dv = change in volume
v = volume of the fluid
d = change in density

## Bulk modulus (K):

The bulk modulus of elasticity K is defined as the ratio of compressive stress to volumetric strain. Mathematically it
is the reciprocal of compressibility.

$\beta_c = -\frac{dv/v}{dp} = \frac{d\rho/\rho}{dp}$

The bulk modulus of liquid and solid are the property of material. In other words, for a given liquid and solid, bulk
modulus will be constant.
For gases, bulk modulus is not the property of material but depends on the process.

# Types of Fluid:

## Ideal Fluid:

A fluid which has 0 viscosity, incompressible and zero surface tension is known as Ideal Fluid. 
## Real Fluid:

A real fluid is a fluid which has viscosity, finite compressibility and surface tension.

# Fluid Statics
Pressure is the term used for a force distributed over an area

Pressure can be measured in two different ways

Absolute pressure: 

is the pressure measured above an absolute or perfect vacuum. The absolute pressure of the surrounding atmosphere is approximately and a perfect vacuum is 0 psi or 0 kPa.

Gage pressure:

is the pressure indicated by a standard pressure gage. The gage reads zero when exposed directly to the atmosphere, positive when the pressure is higher than atmospheric pressure, and negative pressure indicates a vacuum. In effect, pressure gages ignores the pressure of the atmosphere which surrounds us.

## Principles of Fluid Statics:

A fluid, like water or air exerts a pressure on its surroundings. This pressure applies a distributed load on surfaces surrounding the fluid, like the face of a dam, an irrigation control gate, a teakettle, or the drum of a steam boiler.

When you dive underwater, the pressure you feel in your ears increases with depth. At the surface, the gage pressure is zero no matter which unit system you use. As you descend, the fluid pressure p increases with depth according to the equation

$P = \rho g h$

where:🔗
 - p is the density of a fluid,
 - g is gravitational acceleration, and
 - h is the height of fluid above the point of interest.

Since fluid pressure increases linearly with depth, it behaves as a distributed load which increases linearly from 0 at the surface to pgh at depth h, acting normal to the surface. The pressure can be replaced with an equivalent force acting through the centroid of the triangular loading, with a magnitude equal to the triangular area. The pressure on horizontal surfaces is constant, and it is normal to all surfaces.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/598319fd-8d59-457a-968d-8f0d901f84f4)

## Pascal’s Law and Fluid Statics

According to equation (12.16),

$p = p_0 + \rho g h$

The pressure at any depth $h$ in a fluid may be increased by increasing the surface pressure $p_0$.

Pascal recognized a consequence of this fact that we now call **Pascal’s Law**:

> **A pressure applied to a confined fluid at rest is transmitted equally and undiminished to every part of the fluid and the walls of the container.**

This principle is used in a **hydraulic jack or lift**, as shown in the figure below.

---

### Hydraulic System Principle

The pressure due to a small force $F_1$ applied to a piston of area $A_1$ is transmitted to the larger piston of area $A_2$.

Since the pistons are

# Kinematics of Fluid Flow:

Kinematics of fluid flow deals with the motion of fluid particles without considering the agency producing the motion. This deals with the geometry of motion of fluid particles. This also deals with the velocity and acceleration of fluid particles in motion. The motion of a fluid can be analysed on the same principles as those applied in the motion of a solid.

## Methods of Describing Fluid Motion:
Stream Line:

A stream line is a continuous line in a fluid which shows the direction of the velocity of the fluid at each point along the line. The tangent to the stream line at any point on it is in the direction of the velocity at that point. Fluid particles lying on a stream line at an instant move along the stream line.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0365ceff-e80e-4d5c-bcf3-716fe0aa6680)

- For example, as a fluid flows round a cylindrical body, the stream line pattern will be as shown in Fig. 6.3. In steady flow the velocity at a point does not change in its magnitude and directions Hence, there is no change in the direction of the velocity vector at a point. In other words, the stream line is fixed in position. Conversely, if the stream line pattern remains constant the flow is steady. In the case of an unsteady flow, the direction of the velocity changes with time at every point. This means the position of a stream line is not constant. The position of a stream line changes from instant to instant.

### Path Line:

A path line means the path or a line actually described by a single fluid particle as it moves during a period of time. The path line indicates the direction of the velocity of the same fluid particle at successive instants of time.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e02bbdcd-4e94-43da-a917-c33a89500c5e)

### Streak Line:

- The streak line is the locus of the positions of fluid particles which have passed through a given point in succession. Suppose A, B, C, D… are fluid particles which passed through a reference point say the origin one after the other in succession. These particles have described their own path lines. Suppose at a time t, these particles A, B, C, D… are at Pa,

Pb, Pc, Pd …. The line Pa, Pb, Pc, Pd …. is the streak line, at time t.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/041f97ae-3d6c-48b3-aafa-df9f6ee08283)

### Stream Tube:

- A stream tube is an imaginary tubular space formed by a number of stream lines. It is an assembly or collection of stream lines forming a tabular space. The surface of a stream tube is made up of stream lines. The velocity of a fluid particle on the surface of the stream tube is along the stream line over the surface of the stream tube. This means there can be no flow across the walls of a stream tube.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7a7c4f1-10b3-459d-b7a2-3c0cf55842ab)

### Potential Lines:

- On a surface consisting of stream lines, we can imagine lines running orthogonally with the stream lines. Such line are called potential lines.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71a3f39e-cc88-4827-a45b-9e1899bdee89)

## Types of Flow:

(i) Laminar flow and turbulent flow.

(ii) Steady flow and unsteady flow.

(iii) Uniform flow and non-uniform flow.

(iv) Rotational and irrotational flow.

## (i) Laminar and Turbulent Flow:

Laminar Flow:

- This is a type of flow in which the fluid particles move in layers, gilding smoothly over adjacent layers. There is no transportation of fluid particles from one layer to another. The fluid particles in any layer move along well defined stream lines.

- The paths of the individual particles do not cross each other. This type of flow is also called stream line flow or viscous flow. This is a smooth flow of one layer of fluid over another. This type of flow occurs in viscous fluids where viscosity influences the flow.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75e54ebd-a3e7-44f3-ac7d-e32080615a54)

Turbulent Flow:
- This is the most common type of flow that occurs in nature. This flow is characterised by random, erratic, unpredictable motion of fluid particles which result in eddy currents. There is a general mixing up of fluid particles, in motion. The velocity changes in direction and magnitude from point to point.
- There is a continuous collision between particles resulting in transference of momentum between them. The eddy currents cause a considerable loss of energy compared to the loss of energy in laminar flow. This greater loss of energy is due to the fact that turbulent shear stresses are very much greater than laminar shear stress given by Newton’s law of viscosity.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98dcbdb7-926c-44a0-ae17-6f1d6a0ffc90)

## (ii) Steady Flow and Unsteady Flow:

Steady Flow:
- If the flow characteristics like, velocity, density, pressure etc. at a given point in a flowing mass of fluid does not change with the passage of time, the flow is said to be steady. On the contrary, if these flow characteristics at a given point change with respect to time, the flow is said to be unsteady flow.
- Since velocity is a commonly adopted characteristic of flow it is quite sufficient to regard the flow to be steady if the velocity at a given point does not change with respect to time.
- Suppose V is the velocity at a point (x1, y1, z1). At this point if V remains constant at all times the flow is a steady flow. But, if at this point, V changes with time the flow is unsteady flow i.e.,

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb600e23-2205-4eec-8434-ce126639bcdd)

(iii) Uniform and Non-Uniform Flow:

- If the flow characteristics like velocity, density, pressure etc. at a given instant remain the same at all points, the flow is uniform. If V is chosen as a flow characteristic, then, at a given instant V has the same value at all points and is independent of the space position. If the flow characteristics have different values at different points at a given instant of time, the flow is non-uniform flow.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbc979d1-f486-4b46-b15b-610612da6464)

# Viscous Flow:

- Viscous flow refers to the flow of a fluid where viscosity (internal friction between fluid layers) significantly affects the motion. It contrasts with ideal (inviscid) flow, where viscosity is neglected.

  Viscosity (μ):

A measure of a fluid’s resistance to deformation.

Units: Pa·s or N·s/m² (SI units)

Types of Viscous Flow:

### 1. Steady Flow:
   
- A steady flow is one in which conditions (velocity, pressure, and cross-section) can vary from point to point, but do not change over time.

- In real conditions, it is very rare to have such flows with parameters that are constant over time. The parameters usually change over time but the variance is within a small range such that the average of a particular parameter remains constant for a fixed time.

  ### 2. Unsteady Flow:
 
- If at any point in the fluid, the conditions change over time, the flow is said to be unstable. (In practice there is always a slight difference in velocity and pressure, but if the average values ​​are constant, the flow is assumed to be constant.

- A constant flow can be uniform or non-uniform and thus, an unstable flow can also be uniform or non-uniform. For a steady flow, the discharge is constant over time, and for uniform flow, the area of ​​the cross-section of the fluid flow through the flow stream is constant.

  ### 3. Uniform Flow:
 
- If the flow parameter remains constant with distance along the flow path, then the fluid flow is known as uniform flow.

- For a uniform flow, the area of ​​the cross-section of the flow must remain constant. So a suitable example of uniform flow is the flow of a fluid through a pipeline of constant diameter. Conversely, the flow through a pipeline of variable diameter will be essentially non-uniform.

  ### 4. Non-uniform Flow:
 
- The fluid flow is non-uniform if the flow parameters change and are varied at different points on the flow path.

- If at a given moment, the velocity is not uniform at every point then the flow is non-uniform. (In practice, by this definition, each fluid that flows near a solid boundary will be non-uniform because the fluid at the boundary must have a boundary speed, usually zero. However, the flow is assumed to be uniform if the shape and size of the cross-section of the fluid stream are constant).

  # Reynolds number:

  The term Reynolds number is the ratio of inertia force to the viscous force present in the fluid.
It is denoted by the symbol Re.

Mathematically, Reynolds number is given by,

The Reynolds number is given by:

$$
R_e = \frac{\rho \cdot u \cdot L}{\mu}
$$

Where,
ρ = Density of fluid
u = Average velocity of fluid
L = Characteristics length
μ = Dynamic viscosity of the fluid

The Reynolds number has the following importances:-

1) The Reynolds number indicates the relation between inertia forces and viscous forces in the fluid flow.
2) Based on the Reynolds number, the criteria was developed to identify the type of flow.

# Dimensional Analysis:

- The study of the relationship between physical quantities with the help of dimensions and units of measurement is termed dimensional analysis. Dimensional analysis is essential because it keeps the units the same, helping us perform mathematical calculations smoothly.

Homogeneity Principle of Dimensional Analysis:

- Principle of Homogeneity states that dimensions of each of the terms of a dimensional equation on both sides should be the same. This principle is helpful because it helps us convert the units from one form to another.

## Applications of Dimensional Analysis:

Dimensional analysis is a fundamental aspect of measurement and is applied in real-life physics. We make use of dimensional analysis for three prominent reasons:

- To check the consistency of a dimensional equation
- To derive the relation between physical quantities in physical phenomena
- To change units from one system to another

## Limitations of Dimensional Analysis:

  Some limitations of dimensional analysis are:

- It doesn’t give information about the dimensional constant.
- The formula containing trigonometric function, exponential functions, logarithmic function, etc. cannot be derived.
- It gives no information about whether a physical quantity is a scalar or vector.

In a Pelton turbine, water is directed through nozzles to form high-velocity jets that impinge on bucket-shaped blades mounted around the periphery of a wheel. The kinetic energy of the water is transferred to the wheel, causing it to rotate and generate electricity. Since the water jet strikes only a specific portion of the runner and operates at atmospheric pressure, cavitation is minimized, enhancing the turbine's longevity and efficiency.

 # Francis Turbine
The Francis turbine is a widely used reaction turbine that combines radial and axial flow concepts. It is designed to operate efficiently over a wide range of heads and flow rates, making it suitable for various hydroelectric power applications

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22d007a5-0b60-4300-845f-5363e53f2c9f)

Type: Inward-flow reaction turbine
Flow Direction: Mixed (radial at inlet, axial at outlet)
Operating Head Range: 40 to 600 meters
Power Output Range: A few kilowatts to 800 megawatts
Invented by: James B. Francis in 1849


### Main Components
Penstock: A large-diameter pipe that conveys water from the reservoir to the turbine.
Spiral Casing: A spiral-shaped casing that evenly distributes water around the runner.
Stay Vanes: Fixed vanes that direct water flow to the guide vanes.
Guide Vanes (Wicket Gates): Adjustable vanes that control the flow rate and direction of water entering the runner.
Runner: The rotating part with curved blades where water imparts energy, causing rotation.
Draft Tube: A gradually expanding tube that discharges water from the runner to the tailrace, aiding in energy recovery.

### Working Principle
Water from the penstock enters the spiral casing and is directed by stay vanes to the guide vanes. The guide vanes adjust to control the flow rate and direct water onto the runner blades. As water passes through the runner, it transfers energy to the blades, causing the runner to rotate. The water then exits through the draft tube into the tailrace.

# Centrifugal Pumps
A centrifugal pump operates by using a rotating impeller to impart velocity to a fluid, which is then converted into flow or pressure energy. The fluid enters the pump near the rotating axis and is accelerated outward by the impeller, increasing its velocity and pressure before being discharged through the outlet .

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e3e5d05-a141-4fcd-8774-c32704492b9f)

 Working Principle
Centrifugal pumps operate on the principle of converting mechanical energy into hydraulic energy through centrifugal force. When the impeller rotates, it imparts kinetic energy to the fluid, increasing its velocity. This high-velocity fluid then enters the volute casing or diffuser, where its velocity energy is converted into pressure energy, resulting in fluid flow.

2. Types of Heads
Suction Head (hs): Vertical distance between the fluid source and the pump's centerline.

Delivery Head (hd): Vertical distance between the pump's centerline and the delivery point.

Static Head (Hs): Sum of suction and delivery heads.

Manometric Head (Hm): Total head against which the pump works, including losses due to friction and velocity. 

3. Efficiencies
Manometric Efficiency (ηₘ): Ratio of manometric head to the energy imparted by the impeller.

Mechanical Efficiency (ηₘₑ): Ratio of power delivered to the impeller to the power supplied by the motor.

Overall Efficiency (ηₒ): Product of manometric and mechanical efficiencies; ratio of output power to input power.

4. Characteristic Curves
Characteristic curves illustrate the performance of a centrifugal pump under various conditions:
Head vs. Discharge (H-Q Curve): Shows how the head decreases with increasing flow rate.
Efficiency vs. Discharge: Indicates the efficiency at different flow rates, peaking at the Best Efficiency Point (BEP).
Power vs. Discharge: Depicts how the power requirement changes with flow rate.
NPSH Required vs. Discharge: Shows the Net Positive Suction Head required to avoid cavitation at various flow rates. 
Linquip
Rotech Pumps

5. Cavitation
Cavitation occurs when the local pressure in the pump falls below the fluid's vapor pressure, leading to the formation of vapor bubbles. These bubbles collapse violently, causing noise, vibration, and potential damage to pump components

Types of Cavitation:
Suction Cavitation: Happens when the pump inlet pressure is too low, often due to high suction lift or clogged filters.
Discharge Cavitation: Occurs when the pump discharge pressure is excessively high, leading to recirculation within the pump. 

Prevention:
Ensure adequate NPSH (Net Positive Suction Head) is available.
Avoid excessive suction lift.
Maintain proper pump selection and operation near the BEP

 # Reciprocating Pump
A reciprocating pump is a type of positive displacement pump that utilizes a piston, plunger, or diaphragm moving back and forth within a cylinder to transfer fluids. This mechanism is particularly effective for applications requiring high pressure and precise fluid control.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd0084aa-42ef-4fff-b48f-c06cab60192d)

### Working Principle

The operation of a reciprocating pump involves two primary strokes:

1. **Suction Stroke**: As the piston retracts, it creates a vacuum within the cylinder. This pressure difference causes the suction valve to open, allowing fluid to enter the cylinder from the source.
2. **Delivery Stroke**: When the piston advances, it compresses the fluid inside the cylinder, increasing its pressure. This pressure forces the delivery valve to open, pushing the fluid out through the discharge pipe.

This cycle repeats continuously, enabling the pump to move a fixed volume of fluid with each stroke .

###  Key Components

* **Cylinder**: The chamber where the piston moves to facilitate suction and discharge.
* **Piston/Plunger/Diaphragm**: The moving element that creates the necessary pressure differential.
* **Suction and Delivery Valves**: One-way valves that control the entry and exit of fluid.
* **Crankshaft and Connecting Rod**: Convert rotary motion from a motor into the reciprocating motion of the piston.
* **Air Vessel**: Optional component that helps in smoothing out the pulsating flow and reducing pressure fluctuations .

###  Types of Reciprocating Pumps

* **Single-Acting Pump**: The piston performs suction and discharge in one direction only.
* **Double-Acting Pump**: Both sides of the piston are utilized for pumping, allowing suction and discharge during both strokes.
* **Diaphragm Pump**: Uses a flexible diaphragm instead of a piston, suitable for handling corrosive or viscous fluids .
###  Advantages

* Capable of generating high pressures, making them suitable for applications requiring forceful fluid delivery.
* Provides precise control over fluid flow, beneficial for dosing and metering applications.
* Can handle a variety of fluids, including those that are viscous or contain solids .

###  Disadvantages

* Typically have lower flow rates compared to centrifugal pumps.
